"This laptop is actually a desktop replacement machine. The screen clarity and brightness is noticeably better than any monitor that I own. The Solid State Drive makes for fast booting. 
One of the few drawbacks is that it takes two brick power supplies to run the machine. I've had it for over a year now... and the touch activated numeric keypad no longer lights up or recognizes numeric input. The keypad still works good as a mouse pad/pointer though. The bells and whistles far exceed any of my previous laptop machines.",Oomchaw,Fantastic Machine!,0,0,"MSI - GT Series Titan 18.4"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 32GB Memory - Dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 - 1TB HDD + 1.024TB SSD - Aluminum Black",4

"It’s been almost 3 months with this laptop, What can I say, acer... outstanding job with this monster of a laptop. Worth every penny. Laptop runs ANY current game AT the moment. The only downside of the laptop is the noise of the fans when they are at high speed... but WHO cares about the noise when you are able to run ANY game at ultra settings!!!

"So i think i bought the open box return of the other person. I have none of the issues suggested. YES the chassis is hot. I believe by design. I put a temperature monitor and have no issues. I believe they are purposely pushing the heat out of the chassis and that's why it feels hot, but it's doing it's job and keeping the components where they should be. For the most part they stay under 90 degrees C and are usually much lower when not under load. The screen is fantastic, I am a part time professional photographer that also does video work. Everything looks great. The audio is the best i've heard on a laptop. Performance is also superb.

"While this machine is a fantastic beast, I cannot fathom what exactly inspired Razer to NOT backlight any of the symbols on the number keys or F keys. Seriously??? In a dim room I need a flashlight and a sticky note telling me what symbols belong to what keys. Hate the mechanical keyboard also-I can’t imagine other gamers won’t hear this clicking and clacking through my headset.

Huge specs that can handle anything but runs so hot that it shuts off playing not very demanding games. Typing this review with nothing running but 1 tab in Chrome I can feel the heat of this thing. Should also mention that the room is chilled and I bought a cooling pad for it and it still over heats and shuts off.

"This laptop has been exceptional. My needs for a portable powerhouse also required something truly easy to move around and this is one of only two laptop on the market and the only one carried here that has the required specs. Portable enough to carry around like a regular laptop, only about 0.7 in thick, and powerful enough to play modern games at even 4K resolution. The majority of the time I am using this laptop for professional support, but the 144 Hz panel is a game changer even with the simplest of tasks.The keyboard takes some getting use to especially when being used on your lap, cooling design is a little unrefined due to the flimsy flap that opens underneath the unit, and battery life is quite bad(around 2 hr regular use) but that is expected from a laptop that doesn’t have Nvidia Optimus to switch to intel hd graphics for regular use and a 6 core i7. Long story short, nothing compares to the power in almost ultra book sized frame, but for extended use I’d recommend bringing along the medium sized power adapter and the included wrist rest to make the keyboard easier to type on.",TypeCaster01,Innovation with little compromise,6,0,"ASUS - ROG Zephyrus 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Metallic Black",4

Fans are a little loud but adjustable via settings. Very satisfied with performance and display with a qualifier. My only complaint was a big one. The laptop would occasionally freeze and require a hard reset. No particular pattern I could detect. Happened a few times during light use of email and general browsing. Was considering a return and then after research downloaded GE Force experience from Nvidia. Running the wizard found several drivers in need of update. Hasn’t frozen since.

"It's slick but not worth the money. If you wanted the configuration exactly as it is, which under performs against its identically spec'd competitors, then maybe it's for you. If you saw it and thought ""I could easily boost the Ram up to 32Gb and do a little OC tweaking here and there"" then this isn't your rig. Dell (Alienware) opted not to support XMP with this unit (and possibly others, I'm only here for this one) which means you have to used Dell Ram (or another non-XMP product - which are a pain to try and find and not well reviewed or mainstream) at a higher price or else you won't hit your advertised speeds, only the base clock rate (usually 2400 or less for a 2666) and you aren't able to modify any RAM settings (voltage, memory multiplier etc) without having to go to a 3rd party BIOS (not easy to find) and then your warranty won't be supported. The command center is ok but very basic and not at all what I'd want for any kind of performance evaluation/tweaking/optimizing and if you try to go with XTU (since this has a sweet i9) its hands are tied, shoes encased in cement and it's teetering on the edge of a pier. Ultimately, it looks sharp and has a nice form factor but is a total letdown in terms of flexibility. Having listened to a talk by some Dell/AW developers recently I was excited as they seemed to encourage folks to get into their systems and do at least some minor mods and tweaks themselves but then they produce a product that punishes punishes you for trying. I've never owned an AW before, having always been with lower tier Asus/Dell etc, and I was very excited for this to arrive. But, having had this for a few weeks now and really seeing what it will do and what I can do with it, I would avoid this system and go with a comparably speccd Asus again (nothing against MSI etc, I just had a really good experience with Asus).",NKDA,Avoid,7,5,"Alienware - 17.25"" Laptop - Intel Core i9 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 OC Edition - 1TB HDD + 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",1

"The New Razer Blade is Razer's 14"" high-end, portable, VR-ready, gaming laptop that became available for purchase in October of 2016. It's powered by Intel's 6th Generation Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) with Hyper-Threading and NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1060 GPU(6GB GDDR5 VRAM) based on the Pascal Architecture. The laptop contains 16GB of dual-channel system memory(2133 MHz) and a PCIe-based SSD with options of 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. It has a Unibody Aluminum Chassis that's 0.70"" thick and weighs about 4.16lbs. It includes Killer Wireless 802.11ac communication and Bluetooth 4.1. It charges off of a 165W compact power adapter and comes with a one-year warranty.
~Design/Chassis: A lot of work went into the design of The New Razer Blade and its design will impress virtually anybody, this is one sleek looking laptop. The smooth CNC aircraft grade aluminum chassis is light and highly durable; it's denseness, matte black finish with rounded edges and signature glowing Razer symbol on the top give the laptop a high-end, expensive look. Even though It's marketed as a ""gaming laptop"", to those who just want a high-powered laptop to do some video, sound or photo editing, it could easily pass for an alternative to the MacBook Air. It sets the standard for how a modern, portable gaming laptop should look: attractive and sophisticated, without drawing too much attention to itself.
The hinge of the laptop feels strong and the lid rotates on the fulcrum smoothly without juddering or any abnormal noises. The lid snaps shut securely but since it sits flush with the bottom half of the chassis it's somewhat difficult to open the lid from the sides but there is an indentation on the front of the laptop to allow you to easily open the lid.
It's very light and comfortable to hold and carry around. It feels like an expensive machine just holding it but one thing you'll notice soon enough after picking it up are the fingerprints.. It's not uncommon to metal laptops but if you're like me and can't stand the site of them, you'll be cleaning the Razer Blade quite often. It also has two 11"" long rubber seats that run along the bottom side of the laptop.
~Display: The 14"" screen for the Full HD model of The New Razer Blade(which I'm reviewing here) is a 1920x1080 matte/non-glossy display and does not have touch screen capability. In comparison, the QHD+ version of the New Razer Blade sports a 3200x1800 glossy IGZO(Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide) capacitive touch-screen display.
For this 14"" screen, the 1080p resolution is more than sufficient, the screen looks gorgeous. Spending the extra amount for the same 14"" but at a higher resolution isn't necessary. The non-reflective screen for this Full HD version makes it more suitable for use in both the sunlight outside and dark environments; I used this New Razer Blade outside in the sun a number of times and while not 100% perfectly readable, the glare on a matte screen is much less a problem compared to a glossy screen. Images appear very crisp and bright, the screen responds quickly, reading a large amount of text is comfortable on the eyes and the screen is easily viewable from either side angle—which is one of its best features and a great attribute if friends are gathered around watching you game or your playing a video. I streamed a handful of movies such as Casino Royal, Iron Man and Finding Dory and each one of them looked great. The blacks are deep and the colors are bright and vibrant without looking washed. It's a stunning IPS display.
~Audio/Sound: It's more than likely that you will be using your own set of external speakers or headphones on the laptop but the quality of the internal stereo speakers is only decent. While I haven't noticed any distortion from the speakers—even with the volume very loud—and higher pitched sound effects come through clearly, the lower end is certainly lacking.
~Keyboard & Touchpad: The keyboard is a solid design and one of the best I've ever used. The keys have short, punchy travel and bouncy return. The keys are slightly noisier than my Dell XPS laptop but quieter than an average desktop keyboard and there no flex or bend to the panel when typing, It's structurally sound.
They keys are powered by Razer Chroma, which is Razer's individual key backlighting software that's available on numerous Razer products such as Laptops, Razor Core, Mice and Desktop Keyboards. Each key is capable of reproducing 16.8 million colors. There is a fair amount of personal customization available; you can change the duration, brightness, which color you would like to use with the chosen effect or you could choose a select number of keys for individual backlighting(such as common keys W,A,S,D, used for gaming) and leave the remaining keys without a backlight effect.
One thing I wish that was backlit are the top symbol keys. If you're in the dark(unless you have the keys memorized) it's hard to see where the symbols are.
The Touchpad tracks your finger smoothly, it's sturdy and easy to use but I wish that the right and left select buttons below the touchpad were slightly larger. When I'm using the touchpad and I go to press down on the left button to select—without looking down at the touchpad—I have to search for the button with my finger because the thing's so darn small that most of the time you reach over it or not far enough. 
~Ports: The New Razer Blade has 3 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI out, a 3.5mm headphone/microphone jack and a single Thunderbolt 3(USB-C) port. There are no ports on the rear or front of the laptop(keeping with the clean look), only the left and right sides. There is no SD card slot, which is a bit of a disappointment. 
~Performance: And here's the main reason you would be purchasing The New Razer Blade and I'm happy to say that It performs just as a high-end gaming laptop should. I've played a variety of games from the more simple(Costume Quest, Castle of Illusion, ABZU) to more demanding(Metro: Last Light, DOOM, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) and each one of them played well and kept a consistent frame-rate at 1920x1080 resolution with all of the bells and whistles turned on very high or ultra settings.
While playing DOOM(2016) with every advanced video option turned to Ultra settings at 1920x1080 the Blade is able to maintain a steady range of 50-55fps with a minimum of 39fps.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided with all settings on turned up to Very High/Ultra at 1920x1080 it was able to maintain an average of 52fps with a rare dip down to 36fps. Batman: Arkham Knight: The benchmark test and gameplay yielded the same results: 1920x1800, 50fps average and 33fps minimum.
Metro: The Last Light Redux turned out to be the most challenging game I tested for the New Razer Blade, with the video options on Very High the frames-per-second end up in the low 20s(I was getting from 20-24fps), so you'll have to drop Texture Filtering down to AF 4X and SSAA down to 2X in order to maintain a solid 50-60fps. I also ran the 3DMark Fire Strike test(scored a 9,038) and Time Spy test(scored a 3,100). 
~Battery: The Battery life for this 70Wh battery is pretty decent. For low load tasks( Watching TV Shows/Movies, Browsing Sites,ect) it'll last just about 5 hours on a full charge. After I fully charged the battery, I played a few games on very high/ultra settings to see how long the battery could last.
I played DOOM and then Deus Ex:HR non-stop for about 2 hours and 15 minutes until the battery was fully depleted.
The Charger itself does get very warm, I clocked the temperature of the charger at 148F
~Heat/Temperature: This is probably the biggest complaint I have with The New Razer Blade, It does get hot and the fans do get quite loud at full speed—which is anytime you run a visually demanding game—but keep in mind, it is a very thin gaming laptop so it shouldn't exactly be surprising to anyone that these fans can get loud at times. You can still hear the sound from the stereo laptop speakers when the fans are whirring but most of the time you'll want to be using headphones or external speakers so you won't have a problem hearing the game you're playing or somebody overhearing the fans during a voice chat. Since it is a gaming laptop and it's being pushed to run high-end games, It's to be expected that it would throw some heat and the fans would be a little loud but on the positive side I've never had it get to the point though where a game crashed because the temperature was too high.
At idle or just performing low to mid-level load tasks such as browsing the web or streaming videos, the blade's fans are virtually silent.
Underneath the laptop can get quite warm under stressful applications. After running benchmark tests, I temp tested the underside of the body using an infrared thermometer and pegged temp at 113F, the keyboard at 109F, the touchpad at 87F and the screen at 90F. The keys closer to the touchpad are obviously cooler, while the keys closer to the screen are warmer. Since those rubber strips on the bottom don't lift the laptop much off of the surface, the Razer Blade needs to be placed on a hard flat surface in order to dissipate the heat properly.
 ~Price: The price is on the higher-end of the spectrum but is on par with the equivalent New Alienware 13 and GIGABYTE Aero laptops but is slightly more expensive than the Asus ROG Strix GL502
~Overall Thoughts: The New Razer Blade runs a little hot but It's also one of the fastest and most attractive game laptops out there. During the two months or so I've been using it, it's also proved durable and reliable - there's nothing worse than finally purchasing a big-ticket item only to have it riddled with issues that lead you to regret your purchase. To sum it all up; If you want a machine that can run any game out there, with decent battery life, has a bright and stunning display, and that stands-out, not just as a gaming laptop but as a sleek ultra-portable, then this is for you.",VideoGameScores,The New Razer Blade(2016) Review,15,3,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",4
"I would suggest avoiding Razer products at all costs, the company as a whole cares very little for their customers -

My story:
I purchased a Razer Blade, and after approximately a year (pretty much immediately after the base warranty ended), the power adapter stopped being recognized by the system - and thus the battery would not charge. I noticed this while I had the device in a meeting, and simply thought maybe the plug in the room wasn't working - so didn't think it was that big of a deal. The battery ended up draining complete, I went home, and plugged it in... and the computer would no longer boot. There was literally no power at all running to the system, the keyboard lights wouldn't come on... the power button did absolutely nothing at all. However, the AC adapter light was still green - so power was technically flowing to the system.

I did some research online and found that this is a known issue, experience by tons of users - Razer even has a full article on this issue on their own support website.

Pay careful attention to the fact that they know it's a problem with their systems, and they have an update... but they have NOT proactively communicated to customers who own the Razer Blade to get this update (my Laptop was registered from their site, and purchased through their site.. they 100% know I have a problem machine). Basically, this means anyone who's battery drained completely - would be forced to go through their service center to address the issue - as the only fix is opening up the machine.

I contacted Razer Support for assistance, first by e-mail and was told that they would send me an RMA label and instructions to send the device in for repair. A week went by and no such label or instructions were ever sent. Next, I called Razer support by phone, and the representative basically told me the exact same thing that the e-mail rep told me, that an RMA label and instructions would be sent out to me. Again, another week went by and no such label or instructions were ever sent to me.

Note: For transparency, about 2 weeks before this happened, I just got out of critical condition in the hospital - and was on a number of pain killers and medications. So, my patience was very thin, I had a bunch of personal files on the system - and was feeling completely disrespected and ignored by Razer.

So, a bit enraged now, I called back into Razer support and asked for the issue to be escalated or to speak to a manager, as I had now spent the better part of a month attempting to go through the proper channels to resolve the issue with no progress. I was put on hold for over 20 minutes by the first representative and then ""accidentally"" hung up on by the second representative when they were attempting to transfer me.

I installed the Twitter app and went to Min-Liang Tan's (CEO of Razer) Twitter and called out that I was being ignored and was upset with his company - obviously I expected this to go nowhere, and was promptly ignored again. However, I did this every day, and after about the 3rd day of spamming his Twitter, the Razer Support team messaged me on Twitter and referred to my being ignored/hung-up on etc.. as a ""slight glitch"".

They finally sent me the return labels and information about sending my laptop in to them to get the issue fixed. Almost 2 months after I started the whole process.

Now - the best part of all of this, is that the service department just sent me the invoice for what needs to be repaired - the Motherboard, based upon the known issue of the Motherboard not detecting the AC adapter, and thus no power getting to the machine. This is the literal bill they just sent me:
Part Price (USD)
Motherboard (no power) $1,019.00
Top Assy (track pad fail) $209.00
Battery (not hold charge) $58.00
Rubber foot (front missing) $0.00
Labor Fee $130.00
Optional Repair :
LCD (display have bright spots) $395.00
Total $1,811.00

Note carefully that it specifically calls out repair for the battery not holding a charge. This is a known critical issue with Razer systems that is actually on their support site - and there is an update to address it. However, they NEVER sent that information out to the customer base - thus resulting in lots of bricking systems. Also note that they call out No Power to the Motherboard, and attempt to charge almost the price of a whole new system - again, a KNOWN issue with flaws in their hardware that they are attempting to rip customers off with.

There was/is nothing wrong with the screen on the device that I sent in, I literally use the device for visual projections and adobe graphics - one of the reasons I got a Razer system was for the color matching. The track pad I never use, and the Motherboard is a known fault with their systems. However, they wish to charge me the price of a whole new system - to basically repair their own issue.

Horrible customer support, no proactive communication of known issue and zero accountability for mistakes/problems - by far the worst product experience I've ever had in my entire life.",Omgthisnamesux,Known Critical Issues + Horrible Support,108,14,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",1

Summary
I was on the hunt for a thin and light laptop that travels well, had dedicated graphics, good battery life, and doesn't scream ""I'm a gamer!"" in the boardroom. The Razer Blade 2017 almost was that laptop. The build quality is excellent and is still the closest to a Mac that I have seen on the Windows side, save the Surface line. Unfortunately, it runs hot, it runs loud, and the battery life was not very good. I also encountered something I rarely see - blue screen critical errors in Windows 10. I have literally gone months without seeing those on multiple systems from different vendors, but encounted 5 in the first 3 days of using the 2017 Razer Blade. While performance and build quality is excellent, I simply cannot tolerate a system that is not stable. Considering what you pay for the Razer, it's not a buy for me. In the end, I feel there are other similar options like the Gigabyte Aero 14/15 or Dell XPS 15 that cost less money and are better values. I really wanted to like this, but I ended up returning it as I could not justify paying a premium for this compared to the similar Gigabyte and Dell offerings.

Design
This is a gorgeous device. Think of a MacBook that you wish was matte black and that is essentially what you have here. It's thin, light, and looks every bit of a $2000 computer. Unfortunately, it attracts fingerprints just by looking at it, so you will want to keep a cloth handy or apply a skin to it. The biggest detraction from the design are the huge bezels around the display. I really hope Razer looks at the Gigabyte Aero 15 and Dell XPS line to see what they are doing with their bezels. They could easily fit a 15 inch display into the same casing if they shave the bezels down.

Display
The 14 inch display is 1080p and pleasing to the eye. I didn't notice any issues with it and it gets bright enough for any sort of indoor use. Thankfully, it is a matte display so reflections are not an issue. It is also not a touch display, so you will be using the touchpad or mouse to get things done.

Input devices
The keyboard has the always very cool chroma effect and the keystroke is fine. The worst thing I can say about the keyboard is that the backlight does not show up for secondary functions on keys (like punctuation, volume, or brightness controls). A work around for that is to create a custom chroma key color for the functions you want (and then remember your color scheme). The touchpad uses Elan drivers and is average. It has good gliding characteristics, but sometimes registers false taps and two finger scrolling isn't as smooth as you can find on other machines.

Audio
The speakers are fairly good for a laptop this size. They fire upwards and get loud enough that I did not have any issues hearing them, unless I was playing a game when the fan drowns out everything.

Battery Life
It has a 70wh battery, but the quad core processor really takes a toll on that and I suspect the system is not as optimized in this regard despite me creating a custom power plan that focused on energy savings. I averaged about 6-7 hours of office style use (Chrome, Office apps), which isn't as good as I had hoped for. Doing any sort of gaming will drain the battery in 2-3 hours. This is decent, but you can get similar performance and better battery life out of the Gigabyte Aero 14/15 (94wh) or Dell XPS 15 (97wh). Each of those easily got me 8-10 hours of real world office-style use.

Webcam
It has a 2.0mp camera, but the image quality isn't as good you would expect. If you are big on this, you will want to look elsewhere.
Heat & Fans
Here is where the issues start to add up and become more noticeable. This thing runs warm to the touch, even just sitting at idle with no open apps on a Windows 10 desktop. Once you start to put a little bit of load on it, the heat becomes far more noticeable and the fans rev almost immediately. The fans get LOUD. Having used a similar device in the Gigabyte Aero 15 that has the same video card and processor, the Razer is significantly louder and will drown out any sound in the immediate vicinity.

OS/Bloatware
The device does not ship with any bloatware, which is a great thing. It is a standard Windows 10 Home install with just the Razer Synapse software on top to control the keyboard chroma effects and miscellaneous system tweaks.",Jeff,"Slim and powerful, but runs very hot and very loud",10,0,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",3
"THE GOOD:
- Specs. The specs on this thing are amazing. Core i7, 512 GB SSD, a 1060, with 16gb of ram? Yes please.
- The build. Quality throughout. Well built, sturdy, and (at least on mine) no issues with defects.
- The screen. I opted for the QHD touchscreen. If you are do not care about a touchscreen, GET THE 1080. I don't care too much for the upscale resolution, but the matte finish was a big deal for me. I would love a matte touchscreen, but I actually do use the touchscreen, so I enjoy having the QHD. The colors are vibrant with excellent viewing angles. Great screen overall, but again, if you're not really going to use the touchscreen, save some money and grab the 1080 resolution.
- Performance. I've been able to run most games with full ultra settings comfortably at 1080. Native resolution? Well...a 1060 isn't powerful enough for most of the graphic intensive games I've tried at ultra or max settings. For instance, Witcher 3, 1080 with ultra (hairworks turned off) and it can comfortably run at 55-60 FPS. Arkham knight was running at 50+ FPS at around 54+ FPS at 1080. Tomb Raider (2013) ran the benchmark at 60FPS when on ultimate. GTA V I turned everything to max, 1080, and ran it and got (FPS per pass) 42, 36, 43, 47, and 46. I also turned down a few options and reran it at 1080 and got 59, 60, 60, 60, and 59. If you want to turn up the resolution a bit, you can, but it will be a tradeoff of which settings you need to turn down (obviously). I doubt this is capably of playing games well at 4k, although I do have a 2k monitor and it runs fine on it.
- Core. The razer core is one of the main reasons I updated to the new laptop from my 765m model. With core compatibility I can upgrade graphics cards in the future and have a traditional desktop setting with monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. I also have a cooling pad on my desktop so it stays cool (more on this later). I really like having a set desktop area, with a 2k monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc, but still retaining portability.
- Chroma. Nice incentive to get the razer. It looks neat, but doesn't really serve any practical purposes. I leave mine on the ""fire setting"" most of the time, but it's easy to turn off or change.
- Keyboard and touchpad. The keyboard and touchpad are fine. I wish they would have made the function key purposes light up, but it's a small complaint. The touchpad works fine for everyday use, but who doesn't game with a mouse?
- Portability. This is where the Blade really shines. When I bought my original blade I thought, if this were only a bit smaller....then a while after that they came out with the 14"" version and I was hooked. I love the portability. Perfect size for on the go. PORTABILITY is why you pay more than other brands and it's still (IMHO) decently priced.
- Battery life. I've watched some movies and gotten about 3-4 hours of comfortable view time. That's decent, considering all the power under the hood. Gaming...well...game with it plugged in. I haven't tried to game with it unplugged most of the time, but when I have, 1-2 hours is what I've gotten before windows tells me it's going to turn off. PS: you can buy a non-razer power charger that works fine for around $50, but it's pretty dammed brick-like and not portable like the razer one. Works well if you don't care about portability for a few spots, like at a desk at home.

THE BAD:
- Heat. This thing gets HOT. The areas underneath are HOT. Don't be fooled. It's a ""notebook"" and not a ""laptop"" for a reason! This would probably burn your lap if you put it on bare skin while doing anything intensivine. I use a cooling pad whenever I game because the heating does concern me. That said, the heat IS directed away from common areas, like the WASD keys and touchpad. I ran some thermal monitors and I suspect it may be throttling a bit (temps max out around 83-85C) in some circumstances, but it's not noticeable in games (at least I haven't noticed). The fans do a good job and cooling seems all around better than my 765m model, although this is another weakness...
- Fan noise. Fan noise has never bothered me and it still doesn't. But if you are easily bothered by fan noise, just know that fan noise is an issue with the new version. The fans are ALWAYS on and they can get quite loud, even under low loads. Like I said, doesn't bother me (I just like to know that my $2600 laptop isn't going to become a paperweight due to poor heat management). They do a better job of cooling than my 765m version, however. I think Razer has probably increased it's default fan RPMs in the BIOs or something.",Leonsk,Great portable Slim Gaming Laptop,4,2,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",5
"I am a first time buyer/owner of a Razer laptop. Just purchased a 2017 Blade, 512 GB HDD model and am happy to report that I love it! I have always been a Windows guy up until about 2 years ago when I switched to a top shelf MacBook Pro. I must say that I have been very happy with the MBP and the Mac OS. However, my personal video work on my MBP was not outweighing my work-related need for Windows (yes, I ran BootCamp) and my ""need"" for gaming during my work travel. So, I decided to venture back into the world of Windows laptops. My first foray was the purchase of a MSI GS63VR about two weeks prior to the Razer Blade. That computer gave me nothing but problems. I really did want to like it, but the various issues were just too much. And, call me an Apple snob, but I just could not get past the overall ""feel"" of the MSI vs. my MBP. So, back the MSI went and a search was on for a solid MBP-like Windows machine. Researching brought me to Razer. Honestly, I didn't realize Razer even made laptops (as I owned one of their mousepads only). I purchased one through BestBuy.com as I utilize Best Buy quite often, especially given their low cost shipping, return policies, and brick & mortar stores. The shipping box arrived in short order, about a week ago, and I have been loving this laptop! I am running a second, external Asus VG248QE monitor with the Blade.

My ""sample"" has no dead pixels and just the slightest bit of backlight bleed at the bottom of the bezel that is noticeable during startup only. I have not done any tweaks to power settings, etc. I have added multiple pieces of software, which include many background processes, and then decided to benchmark my system. CrystalDiskMark gave me just shy of 3100 MB/s Sequential Read, Fire Strike gave me a total score of 9258, Time Spy gave me a total of 3623, and I can run Battlefield 1 at 1080P/Ultra/V-Sync with CPU temps staying in the 80's C and GPU right at 72 C. Again, these benchmarks were run with all factory background tasks, Adobe CC, CUE, Logitech software, and a browser window with multiple tabs open all chugging along. I have got to say, I am mighty happy with the machine. As expected, it does sound like a bathroom hand dryer under load, but I didn't expect anything less. It is quiet as a mouse under normal desktop application tasks and the battery seems to last forever with a reduced screen brightness. I have read many complaints and of problems with some people's machines. So, I decided to come on here to at least give some praise about my machine. In the end, if I could have anything different, I would love to have the little bit of backlight bleed fixed. But, that would only be to satisfy my OCD within and would not make any difference in my day to day use of the laptop.",Firetoad,The Windows MacBook Pro!,17,5,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",5
"Very good laptop and worth the money. If you want macbook build quality but want the freedom of windows, this is the go to laptop. I use it for basic day to days tasks and some heavy gaming as well on the go. The nice thing about the pc is that it has bluetooth and with windows 10 has native xbox one controller support, all games(fallout 4 and farcry) that i have played so far have been able to run @ 60fps on high-ultra settings. Battery life is decent (5-7hrs) when doing basic things, but when gaming you get maybe 1-2, which is expected for a machine packing this much power. Only downside is that when gaming or doing anything intensive the laptop fans get very loud, but that was also expected after reading reviews of previous models and is necessary when a laptop this powerful is this small. Another thing I like is the matte screen, most computers have a glossy finish which tends to be annoying when gaming and staring for hours but this has one of the best matte screens I have seen. Overall this computer is a great machine and I have had it for about a month, I have been wanting to buy this machine for almost 2 years and I'm glad that I chose this over any other one. Yes, you can buy a laptop that has the same/more power for less money, however, you will lose out tremendously on build quality. I've compared this machine side-by-side with it's ""competitors"" and it is really in a league of it's own, the only thing that compares to this is a very high-end mac in my opinion. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone that wants a well built ultra-book, and the ability to play Triple-A games @ max settings without having to sacrifice portability and quality. I also recommend getting some kind of sleeve, case, or skin seeing as this is a finger-print magnet. I put a carbon fiber skin on laptop and tracpad because it annoyed me, which i will include pictures of...

"I originally purchased the 256gb model but it was not enough storage so I exchanged it for this one. With that being said both models have been the exact same from fan noise to quality. 

I read a lot of reviews online and watched a lot of videos before making this purchase.

My main concern was the fan noise prior to purchasing. I am delighted to announce that for the most part, I do not have issues with the fan, it is steadily on while playing games at high/ultra setting and it will sometimes rev up (really loud mind you) but usually only for 10-20 seconds and then goes back to a steady speed. I have had no issues with the fan noise while doing anything outside of games. 
With that being said, however, I am not the heaviest of gamers. I play WoW, ES, CS, TellTale games, and a few others. I didn't get to test it on anything too demanding like the Witcher. I can say that if you put WoW on medium settings the fan won't even kick on and it doesn't kick on at all playing CS or Telltale games.

If I could give this a 4.5-star rating I would but unfortunately, you can only do whole star reviews, the reasons being listed below. 

Pros:
Portability/Size/Build quality 
Processor speed/GPU
Display/Customizable backlighting on keys
Razer Synapse (much better than Alienware command center)
Laptop stays cool
Speakers (for how little the laptop is the sound quality is very good)
Having 3 USB ports 
The touchpad feels similar to MacBook.

Cons:
Fan noise (can be a bit loud like mentioned above)
Fingerprint and smudges show up very easily on the lid. 
Only 60hz refresh rate on screen. 
Price is a bit high in comparison to other laptops in the same size range (with that being said I also find it interesting that Alienware offers their ""graphics amplifier"" for a fraction of razers ""core"" and this is something that I would potentially be interested in if the price comes down but that is neither here nor there) 
The function keys and the punctuations/symbols do not light up so you have to remember where each thing is. 
The bezel is a bit big could almost fit a 15inch screen if you eliminated the bezel.

A few recommendations from personal experience thus far and from many hours reading/watching reviews. 
Purchase the protection plan through Best Buy. Many, many, people have said that the Razer support is hit or miss and most of the time is a huge miss. 
Purchase a skin or something equivalent for the lid. As I mentioned the lid shows finger prints and smudges super easy. Also if you ding the machine it is very noticeable since it is a matte black. 
I purchased a laptop fan to help with the cooling of the machine and to keep the fans from getting out of control.

If you're looking for something to be very portable while also being a beast at running games this is the machine you're looking for.
To me, this machine is the gaming windows equivalent to a Macbook.",Noodle,Gaming Windows Equivalent to a MacBook.,5,0,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",5
"I purchased this laptop online through bestbuy and had it for about a period of a week before I had to return it. 
The laptop itself was great and performed really well and I have no complaints about that but the fans were becoming a problem and an annoyance. I noticed that when I first turned it on and began using it the fans were unusually loud (not horribly loud or anything) and I figured out I could configure them using synapse. So I placed them on low settings and the laptop was perfect then. However after about a week they suddenly started turning on and off constantly even when performing simple tasks like powerpoint, microsoft word or even using the internet. Then they started turning on even when there weren't any tasks being performed. For people using this machine for gaming it isn't much of a problem since many will have headphones but for me this was a big problem. The computer was meant to be a school device first and gaming laptop second so it would be pretty embarrassing when I would sit in a silent classroom and suddenly the fans would just start revving up out of nowhere and for no reason. Even our terrible school-issued computers don't do that. 
I did more research and found out that many people were experiencing this issue with the 1060 model and the previous model and razer was looking into it. However, that was over a month ago and it seems nothing is fixed as of yet so unfortunately I just decided to return it. Such a pity though, it was such an awesome laptop and it really sucked to have to return it for something as simple as overactive fans and minor annoyances like that. 
But again just to reiterate, the laptop was powerful, fast and great for gaming and had no performance issues whatsoever and the display was superb. its no wonder it was giving mac a run for its money. However, since I was initially using it as a school laptop first and gaming machine second it was just simply too loud to have in a quiet classroom. If these problems are fixed I would definitely buy it again without hesitation.",CRYMTZ,Great..but unfortunately...,5,3,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",4
"This computer is absolutely amazing. Of course the keyboard lighting is definitely a plus and It is an amazing addition. I love the details and all the fun creative custom lighting setting you can come up with. But besides the lighting, the keyboard itself is amazing to type in. The keys have a great tactile feedback and just enough travel. It is a solid computer. Nice storage (wish it would be bigger considering its a gaming laptop). Games run smooth and swift with very nice FPS and beautiful colors and normal functions are very nice in it. I overall love it. The design is nice sleek and beautiful.

Downsides... probably it is very hard to keep clean and it is overall just a hair louder when the fans kick in. While gaming I don't care, but on basic functions maybe a little. But regarless my love for it way outweights the downsides.",TechSavvy,GREAT LAPTOP,1,0,"Razer - Blade 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",5
"TL;DR: solid gaming laptop with a luxury tax

I would classify myself as a hard core gamer. I built my desktop from scratch and play most modern games. So when my I started traveling more I wanted to be able to game on the road. The important thing to know is you’ll never get the same performance out of a laptop as you would on a desktop. With this in mind I was looking for a laptop with decent specs but high portability. The Blade fits the bill. The 1060 provides nice visuals and i haven’t experienced any bottlenecking on the CPU or with the ram. Granted I’ve only used this machine to play games and haven’t tried streaming with it yet but so far so good. As other reviews will tell you. The blade is very loud when you have the fans set to high. This isn’t something wrong with the machine, Air has to move through the device to keep it cool. Yes they’re better products out there for the price point but if you’re looking for a portable gaming laptop that’s a beast out of the box.

"It is also the first laptop I have ever owned. I needed a portable PC because I had to leave the US for work for over a month. I wanted something lite, slim, nice looking, and efficient. I also didn't want to leave my favorite video games for a month. The Razer Blade was an obvious choice for me. I can do work on it for 7+hours on battery, and when I get back from work i can connect it to power and play any game I want (I play Overwatch, GTA V, and Playerunknowns Battlegrounds) without any problems. Yes when the GTX 1060 turns on it runs loud, but while the onboard graphics card is being used for excel, web browsing, etc. its completely quiet. One thing that really bugs me is that at night there is no way to back light alt keys (? # $ & etc.). I figured with all the customizable colors and schemes for the keyboard that would be a no brainer.

"This is going to be lengthy but hopefully helpful review. 

First of all, ignore the first review. Giving a one star rating is completely unreasonable. 

I will state my old adage. You get what you pay for. 

Now I work in IT so I believe my knowledge in computers is pretty substantial. But that also doesn't mean you should take my word on anything. Do your research. Always. Now let's get on with my review on this laptop. 

This review will be split into two sections. One for those who just want the basics and a second for those who want a detailed technical review. I will provide both. As with any product, there are Strengths and Areas of Improvement. 

------ Section I - The Basics ------

Although Best Buy lists the technical specifications, I know most average users will not go through the trouble of understanding any of the technical jargon so I will simply put what matters most for an average user. 

CPU (the brain of the laptop) - The 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-7300HQ is one of the fastest and newest on the market today and a great value for your money. It will do almost everything you need with no problem.

Memory (RAM) - 8GB is more than enough for your daily needs. It is also upgradeable to 32GB. 

Graphics (the extra fluff) - The graphics card that come equipped with this will more than satisfy your gaming desires. It will run most AAA titles as well as the older titles with ease. Although, this doesn't mean you should run every game at the highest settings possible as this would put stress on any GPU including this one. So run the game at settings you feel like you can manage. I was able to run Watch Dogs 2 at High Settings with no problems.

Storage (Hard Drive) - The Hard Drive that comes with this is more than plenty for your daily needs. It is upgradeable and also has an option to add an additional M.2 SSD storage option. 

Display (the window) - Now the display is what most people will notice and what most people will complain about. But like I said, you get what you pay for. Companies such as Dell had to cut the cost for this laptop from somewhere and in this case it is the display. But this reason alone should not be the determining factor to buy or not to buy. Most consumers are used to the glossy clear HD monitors and screens. If this is what you ate used to then, yes, you will be disappointed by the screen on this laptop. But the display panel can be upgraded or even replaced with a better one. So for those more technically adept folks, you are in luck here. I will go more into this in Section 2.

Battery (the life) - The battery is great for a laptop of this size and caliber. Imagine sticking a Prius battery into an F-150 and running entirely on that. You won't get ""Prius"" grade battery life on a gaming laptop but you'll get more than enough. 

Speakers - Laptop speakers are average. I would not expect much from speakers of any laptop as being an audiophile myself you won't get studio grade sound quality from a tiny speaker. Your best bet would be getting external speakers. But the speakers on these are sufficient enough. 

Keyboard - Once again, this is a laptop, don't expect desktop grade keyboards on a laptop. The laptop on this keyboard is actually better than most other laptops in this price range. It has good feedback and does not feel too cheap. As I'm typing on this now, I have no trouble.

"To start with, I will say that I am something of a technophile and I am one of those who builds their own PCs for gaming and what have you--basically, I'd consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to tech and I don't just buy anything and everything without research. 

I mainly eyed this laptop due to the wonderful sale price of $699 versus the included spec. Even at it's full price of 800 though, this is a pretty great bang for you buck sort of purchase. You're getting a quad-core processor, 8GBs of RAM, a discrete (read: separate) graphics card of the Nvidia 10-series, and 1TB (1000 GBs) of hard drive storage. For the less tech-inclined, trust me when I say that this kind of package is normally right at $1000 or even over that so it's a pretty good deal. I personally went for the terabyte storage option versus the SSD of the more expensive configurations because I actually need the storage and I did not want to spend over $1000 for the one with SSD and HDD (I ran out of space on my 1TB twice on my old laptop). 

Getting into the actual operation of the laptop actually brings me to the reason why I took off one star. I had two specific problems that aren't major dealbreakers at all, but it is something that is worth noting and I recommend emulating the solutions I offer. The actual laptop is nice and snappy. Even though it takes a little bit to get going due to the first time setup (and not having an SSD to speed up this process), after everything is done, applications open fast and multitasking is very smooth. I was downloading, installing, internet browsing, and typing up documents in multiple tabs and programs during the first time setup and the computer was just flying. Here's the first caveat, however. 

I HIGHLY recommend that after you turn the laptop on and let Windows set up and everything, you IMMEDIATELY factory reset the PC and let Windows 10 clean install itself. The reason for this is because I found that Google Chrome and any other internet browser is extremely slow in loading pages if you leave everything as is. My internet connection is stellar and my older laptop still opened pages in an instant so with this spec, I knew it couldn't be the computer itself. Once I reset and reinstalled Windows 10, I haven't had that issue ever again. The second thing may only be a problem I, myself, have had. 

I have Steam on my computer (It's a program to download PC games) and it seems that while installing games, the speed of my internet browsers slows. I haven't figured out why this is, but it's easy enough to just install games overnight. Beyond those two problems I mentioned, the computer is pretty glorious. The spec is nice, the price is right, and it will definitely last you at least 3-4 years if you don't do anything crazy to it--maybe even longer. 

I'd be remiss, however, if I didn't mention the display. This is a point of contention with lots of people because the display Dell chose to install is not of great quality. The resolution is full HD, but the display uses a lower quality TN panel that has bad viewing angles and somewhat washed out color reproduction. I personally didn't mind this because I have a PC with an expensive monitor that fulfills my display needs and I feel like the issue was a bit overblown. You can adjust color settings in the Intel Graphics Settings or check around the internet to see what display profiles people used and copy those to improve things. As it stands, I recognize that the display is low quality, but I don't think it's a huge detriment considering the price and spec you get. 

Finally, I'll address some other common Dell complaints. The keyboard is full size with a full numpad and I haven't found it cramped in the slightest. I am a man with large hands and it still suits me just fine. The trackpad being off-center also does not bother me at all. I really don't understand why people make a big deal out of minor things like that and I've seen other Dell computers where the trackpad really was atrocious and in an even worse placement, but the way this laptop is setup is not bad at all. The keys are backlight in a red color and my only complaint there is it's not super bright, but I love the red accents. 

Hopefully, this review helps some people out and maybe puts to bed some myths about Dell computers. Just for reference, I'm coming from a Toshiba Satellite computer that was an i5 dual core, 6GBs of RAM, no discrete graphics card, and smaller. I buy mid-range laptops purposely because I don't need the power due to having an excellent PC, but I really don't regret going a little higher this time and purchasing this one. I didn't touch on gaming at all because I don't use this laptop for gaming, but I did test it out and it seems to play most modern games at high to max settings at 1080p so rest assured it can game as well as it processes. Enjoy your product!",icmasticc,"Great Laptop thus far, will update over time",78,6,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",4
"This is a SOLID laptop. I love it, got it as an Open Box deal from one of my local Best Buy for $50 lower than the actual asking price. It plays all of my Steam and Origin games VERY well, and I couldn't ask for better in terms of performance for it, other than a few things. First of all, this laptop's using Windows 10. I've had it for a few weeks, and was relegated to create a recovery key froom Dell's site on a spare flash drive I had for it and use it twice in the first week I've had this due to Windows related problems that forced me to re-install Windows 10. First, Windows 10 corrupted itself on the PC due to a bad update; the second time Windows, again due to a bad update, blocked my laptop from accessing the internet over both Ethernet and wifi for two days while I searched for the cause of the problem, eventually giving up and reinstalling Windows again, fixing the problem. None of these problems were caused by hardware, just Windows. Thus, if you plan too buy this PC, I would also plan on buying Windows 7 as well as an external DVD drive to install that to avoid having problems with the virus that is Windows 10. The other thing is that this PC does NOT have a built in optical drive, but that's minor. This also, despite being made this year, does NOT support any of the new Windows Hello features save the PIN that you'd use to log in. It doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, and the camera doesn't support facial recognition, so if you're looking to step up your security on your laptop, this may not be the one for you.

Onto my biggest issue with this though, but one that still isn't big enough for me to not recommend this to the average PC gamer. Most people will not use the trackpad on their gaming laptop when gaming or typing, as it would just get in the way of the keyboard, and would opt to shut it off when they are. This laptop lacks that functionality with hardware, and I've not found anywhere on the PC to keep the laptop from recognizing when your hand's heel is rubbing against it. It's also very sensitive. The only way that I can tell with hardware to shut it off is if you have an external mouse plugged into the PC, and Windows 10 does NOT recognize a mouse paired to the PC via Bluetooth as plugged in. So, even though I primarily use my MX Master or MX Anywhere 2 (both great mice from Logitech) on my laptop most of the time, rarely using the trackpad at all (I am not a fan of it as it's somewhat rough and grainy feeling to me and just feels strange), I have no way of disabling it with my hardware as I pair both mice to it via Bluetooth, as I don't want to have to remove a dongle from the PC everytime I choose not to use it or am in a situation where I don't have enough space to be able to use it. As a college student who also plays a lot of MMOs as well as the traditional console style game, like Saints Row or the NBA 2K series, the lack of the ability to shut the trackpad off is more than irritating, both when gaming and when typing a thesis paper for a class. With the kind of hands I have and where it's located, my hands bump it very often, causing half of what I'm typing to become deleted as it's ALSO very sensitive. However, the performance of the laptop itself is very solid, as is the build, so this major annoyance isn't enough to dissuade this from everyone as you CAN disable it by disconnecting the trackpad completely if you don't plan on using it and I'm sure there is software out there that will do this as well.

Ultimately though, for $800, you're getting a computer with a gaming performance that is on par with your $1200 HP OMENs and your lower-ended Alienwares. Which is funny, as the Dell Gaming label is becoming what is still known as and in regards to this model was Alienware. So if you're a loyal Alienware customer and are looking to upgrade your gaming laptop but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is your laptop as this laptop designwise and performancewise screams Alienware with its dual fan systems and four exhaust ports (two on the back, directly in front of the two fans, and two on the bottom that also serve as intake for cooler air to prevent the system from overheating.) Windows also boots in about 10 seconds, and I'm using my laptop in about 15, so the 8GB extra memory from the hybrid drive is GREAT (this is not upgradable, it's NAND cache memory designed to take the weight off the hard drive platter and increase hard drive speeds without needing a faster drive, expanding the drive's lifespan as well). It's a solid laptop, fast and efficent, and other than my minor complaint, is one I strongly recommend.",tigerfan28,"Good, with a few possbily dealbreaking annoyances",26,5,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",5
"This is the first laptop I've purchased in several years. The last Windows OS I'd used was Windows 7 as I typically use my MacBook Pro for most things (my work computer). I got mine from Dell with the 1050Ti and a 256GB SSD, so keep that in mind as I'm reviewing this.

Let's get the elephant in the room (the ""catch"" mentioned in the title) out of the way: the display. Yes, it is bad. There's little ghosting and the response time is acceptable, but that's about where the ""good"" ends. It's bad. Really bad. Colors are washed out, viewing angles are atrocious, and it's fairly dim. Fortunately, it's just a 30-pin edp screen which can be swapped quite easily (I went for a Samsung LTN156HL02 IPS panel which costed about $60. If you do the same, note that IPS panels DO have longer response time and are more prone to ghosting, but look a heck of a lot better than TN panels, and this one is no exception).

Now with that out of the way, let's talk about positives:
1. The biggest positive is the price. It's a bargain, as far as price and performance go.
2. It's quite performant with its 4-core i5. Opting for the SSD (again, I purchased on Dell's site, so that's not an option here) further helped performance. The 1050Ti (again, Dell's site) has the grunt to run most of today's games on high or ultra-high settings at native resolution. HL2's Lost Coast had a framerate of like 275 or so with absolutely maxed-out settings. That benchmark might not matter as much anymore, but I still found it impressive. 
3. Upgrading the RAM, hard drive, etc. is really easy. It's just one screw on the bottom. 
4. (This is subjective) It looks REALLY good (I got the red one, and don't regret my choice for a second). I'm constantly stunned by how pretty the machine is.
5. It's pretty thin and light. Nothing to write home about, but it's only an inch thick and weighs under six pounds. So it's larger in every dimension than my MBP, but weighs about the same and is smaller than any other laptop I've owned (aside from my old Clevo W110ER, but that's a whole 'nother story).
6. The screen, while terrible, does have little-to-no ghosting and great response time. It's also a matte finish, which reduces glare.
7. The keyboard is pretty similar to my MBP's. Keys are a bit squishier (which I don't like), but it's closer than any other Windows machine I've had.
8. The trackpad is REALLY good for a Windows machine. Very similar to the MBP's, just a tad twitchy. Who cares, though, right? You'll probably be using a mouse anyways.
9. The speaker placement is pretty good. They point out the left and right side of the front of the laptop (behind all that mesh). The subwoofer helps the lows.

And some cons:
1. Again, the display. I've harped on it already.
2. The machine IS plastic, so it will feel a bit cheap. It's unavoidable. Thankfully, however, it feels pretty solid in spite of this. And remember, it's plastic for cost savings.
3. This may be subjective, but I don't like the ""soft touch"" texture on the laptop. It's supposed to feel upscale and luxurious, but it just wears through quickly, collects skin oil (blech), and ends up making electronics look cheap/worn-out after only a few months of use. I've mostly seen it used on cheap-o Chinese electronics to try and drive that same feeling home. It doesn't work. And it comes loose when the device in question gets hot, leaving a nasty, sticky residue. It's good for now, but who knows how long that will last? I'd rather have a genuine matte finish on the laptop without the soft-touch coating. 
4. The sound is a bit tinny, even with the sub. It's not a major complaint, though. It sounds ""okay"" and you'll probably be using headphones anyways.
5. To get it up to snuff, you'll need to do some upgrades. I had to drop in a new less-horrific screen, an extra stick of RAM (matched the specs for dual-channel), and a hard drive to supplement my smallish 256GB SSD (Dell's site). I had the hard drive laying around (it was pulled from my father-in-law's old laptop), but had to buy the screen and RAM. This brought the total (with shipping, taxes and all that jazz) to about $1k.

Overall, I'd recommend this to just about anyone who wants to do some gaming-on-the-go. I got mine specifically for game development, which it works well for as well. Why didn't I get a desktop/build my own? Because I work better on the couch (don't judge me) than at a desk and relying on remote desktop/VNC to do so wouldn't be reliable enough. And I'm on the go often, allowing me to work/play on an airplane and whatnot. Plus, did I mention this thing looks good? 

I'd definitely recommend this, though I'd say to do what I did and get the version with a GTX 1050Ti and 256GB SSD and then replace the screen and slap in a hard drive. Bumping up the RAM couldn't hurt, either. It's a great machine that can be made even better.",M47R1X,Excellent machine for the price (with a catch),7,1,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",4
"Don't get me wrong it's ok, but it's really barely anymore power than a PS4. I've been building gaming rigs for nearly 20 years. I got this for a friend of mine, and for him it's good. He basically wanted it to play a few new games but mostly older. Overwatch and GTAV to be exact, and for those it's a bargain. Here are the pros and cons, that I noticed while using it for a little while.
Pros
1. The 1050 is a low budget card but can get the job done mostly on Medium settings. Don't expect to max out much of any thing from 2016-2017..if so it will still play in the mid to low 30fps.
2. Great price, for an 800$ portable gaming laptop, this is a no brainer.
3. Definitely looks like a gaming laptop, sharp red, with the black. Much better than the HP Omen. IMO.
4. Dell own Alienware so I think the reliability on this unit as opposed to others should be very good. Unlike Asus which is less than reliable these days.
5. Speakers are strong, screen is pretty good, not great though. Colors could be better.
6. Great processor especially at this price point, can't really be beaten in a laptop.
Cons
1. Not for hardcore gaming, or 4K. You can't even edit 4K video.
2. Runs extremely LOUD, probably louder than any gaming laptop I've heard. But it does stay very cool.
3. The built is good, not great. It's solid overall but the hinge is very hinky. Seems like it would crack after a lot of use. Unlike having 2 separate ones.
4. Screen is average, personally I would have spent the money for a better panel, or even a 4K screen. Then again what would be the point.
5. Typing flex isn't bad. But the keystrokes don't always register strongly for fast typists like myself.
6. Windows 10 no matter what processor you have is still glitchy and does hang quite a bit. Also you WILL get the BSOD when it wants to change drivers on you. So expect that. It's customary on Gaming Laptops.
 7. Wireless is good, again not great. Spotty in some cases.
Overall this is a good price, probably the best you'll find actually for some casual gaming. On mostly Medium settings. Some on high but with lower framerates. If your game (no pun intended) go for the 1050TI which is quite a bit more powerful. For about 200$ more. If you're looking just for good portable gaming this is great. Anything else, video editing (in 4K especially) or other high end processes. You should really look elsewhere. The graphics card is actually the weak spot. But for the money.

"Buyer Beware. I bought this laptop a week ago today and have had nothing but issues with internet access right out of the box.

After starting up for the first time and going through 1.5 hours of updates the laptop would blue screen constantly with ""Netwtw04.sys"" errors complimented by ""IRQ >="". An internet search revealed this to be a wireless device issue where the device was trying to access IRQ's (system interupts) reserved for the operating system kernal. The wireless device in this laptop is an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165. When I was able to connect speed was like dial-up where pages took forever to load. I went to the Intel website and downloaded and installed the most recent driver available (not installed in the out of box laptop). It did not solve the problem.

I then brought the laptop upstairs and plugged it into my router using an available ethernet port. This worked for a while but then all of sudden internet stopped working because the ethernet LAN configugration was lost and I kept getting ""Invaid IP configuration"" errors. Troubleshooting the issue with Windows 10 sometimes worked, sometimes it didn't. In any case, the ethernet adaptor was reported to have to be reset each time.

I have to say I have multiple devices connected to my wireless router and none have any issues at all and up to this point perform much better than this laptop. This is important for reasons below (my guess).

I finally decided to wipe the system and start over using a Dell support provided ISO image specifically for this laptop. Hours later the blue screens stopped but internet performance is still sluggish at best.

After re-installing Windows 10 with the Dell ISO the system overall performed slower than out of the box. The blue screens stopped but if the laptop is left idle for a period of time internet access crawls again and pages take forever to load (as opposed to a clean shut-down, reboot - restarting doesn't help).

Wireless driver information;

Out of the box: version 19.20.xx, blue screens all the time
Upgraded: 19:50.xx (most recent available), no change
After wiping original Dell installation with Dell ISO image: 18.xx.xx, no blue screens (note the older wireless driver)

At this point the only thing I can suggest for the internet issues is that the Intel Wireless AC adapter doesn't play well with anything other than wireless AC protocol. Unfortunately my router only supports wireless N as a top speed.

My plan of action is to go to Comcast and upgrade my router to AC wireless. If that doesn't work, I'll update the wireless driver.

If that doesn't work the laptop is going back to Best Buy in a body bag.

I'm a apple fanboy for life, so there's a bit of a learning curve for me getting around, but my boy seems really comfortable with the windows os. 

I didn't give it 5 stars due to the fan that seemed a little loud. I'm no stranger to loud fans, but if you're looking for a machine that's dead quiet when the processor is under strain, this isn't it. BUT... i don't think anyone shopping in this price point is looking for absolute perfection. Also, I'm not a fan of the matte screen. Fortunately, I found a thread on reddit that provides upgrade options for a glossy hi res screen. The power supply is a bit clunky, but I assume that's a pc thing. Not sure if this machine is super heavy, or I'm just used to Macs that are super light, but I'm hoping an ssd and a few mods might drop a little weight. 

 I'm looking forward to bonding with my boy and making this his project machine; pulling it apart to upgrade the specs in a few years.

Edit: I went back and gave this computer 5 stars. You get what you pay for and so far this machine hasn't disappointed us.

"Only problem I had was straight out of the box the processor was constantly in turbo boost. Cooling fans were always on. This was simply a power setting in windows. I switched it from performance to a balanced setting.. now it only turbo when it needs to. 

Overall, good computer for what you pay. I light game on it mostly and it handles graphics on high settings for stuff like World of Warcraft. With more demanding games like Star Wars Battlefront, I have to go with low settings to get the best performance, but still smooth and very playable. When under graphics load the fans spin up and are very noticeable... not a big deal for me... I expect that with even a light graphics gaming machine, but some may not like it, and may opt for a more expensive gaming laptop with more power and more quiet cooling. I was on a budget.

Some Dell bloat ware is included, but it does not seem to cause any performance issues for me.

The most negative aspect from this computer is the slower hard drive, it is really noticeable during virus scans and when I use defragmentation tool. Otherwise, it is slower than my desktop, but when I timed it with my desktop loading WOW, Everquest, Everquest 2, Starwars Battlefront, the greatest difference was 35 seconds... usually less. Due to the 8gb hybrid part of the hard drive, my most commonly played games load as fast as my desktop with an SSD. I thought I was going to need to upgrade to an SSD in this laptop, but I no longer see the need. 

Another negative is the monitor screen is not the best... I knew this going into the purchase from other reviews. An IPS would have been better, but this screen is sufficient for my 1080p gaming needs.

I might upgrade the RAM to 16GB in the future to get to the recommended specs for Starwars Battlefront, but for now the 8GB of RAM is sufficient.

"Because many people have already stated the cons and pros with this laptop so accurately, I'll just add my thoughts on how it has treated my son over the weeks since purchasing it.

Display: meh. Wants IPS display because viewing angle is bad and colors are noticably washed out, even with his calibrations.

Perfomance: This laptop is definitely CPU bound, if you aim for the lower end of this laptop, however, it still holds up quite nicely. The 1050 GTX is the real gem in this deal, able to play his popular games such as LoL (whatever that is) and CSGO without any lag whatsoever, and with a minimum of 60 fps with very high or ultra settings.

Thermals: My son is actually pleased that the laptop is made out of plastic rather than a metal frame, but it makes sense because it has gotten very hot while playing his graphic-intensive games. He installed an on-board monitor onto the laptop and told me his temps are around 65-70°C which is fine in a desktop, but still pretty steamy on your lap.

Design: Subjective to every individual, but the black and red design seems to be pretty universal, and I admit that I like it myself. You can certainly tell its no average web surfer, with its red logo and color schemes, but its done subtly enough to where one such as myself can use this in a board room meeting setting. Reminiscent of XPS laptops of yore (haha).

Value: we received the laptop for $700 during a sale, and for the price on similar spec laptops, this is a very good buy. I've used the laptop myself and must admit that it performs very well in terms of price to performance, design, features, and battery life (7.5 hours in his daily runs). If you can spend the extra 100 or 200 to buy the better-equipped version, do it to add even more value.

"I found this particular laptop at a $150 off the retail / open-box discount price after browsing at several local-area best buy stores. At most of those stores, there was a noticeable lack of customer service in the computer department, and I mean bare minimum customer service, like acknowledging the presence of customers in their assigned area. Before I purchased this open-box, I asked the sales guy if it was factory reset, and he assured me that it was, and it had the sticker that said it was certified by the Best Buy Geek Squad... But I got home and turned it on, and it had a password from the previous owner. I called the best buy store to try talking to either of the sales guys who helped me, because I was handed off to a second guy to handle the payment process. I was ready to return the item, but took it to the geek squad customer service just before closing, and he gave me the instructions to do the factory reset myself. That saved the transaction. Before I found this open-box, I was ready to buy the higher-spec model, but would have ended up costing double what I paid for this one, so I'm happy about what I purchased. The performance is up to par, but the screen is sub par, as you may have heard from some of the tech reviews. But what can you expect from a budget gaming laptop? The subwoofer sound and cooling system makes up for it. The fans will come on only when the computer is pushed to its limits, but otherwise remains quiet. The keyboard is nice with the backlight, but I wish it had something better than chiclet-style keys, so I just plug in a standard keyboard. It's a bit behind the times without having a USB-c port, and I still need a DVD drive, so I had to buy an external one, but that's ok, because those are often the first to break, and it's easier to replace external components.

Mechanical drive is included, it was 1TB Firecuda. its crazy to run mechanical drives with the price decline of SSDs. The first thing I did was throw a SSD in it, made a world of difference.

"I originally purchased this laptop with a 1050 ti card and 256gb ssd directly from dell. I usually use a chromebook because my needs for a computer isn't much so therefore i'm by no means knowledgeable about computers.

Anyways, the first computer from Dell froze constantly. Literally just froze, nothing would work. I had to constantly hold the power button down and reboot. Although the Dell customer reps are very polite and helpful, it was a bit of pain calling and dealing with it. I returned the computer. 

I found this computer at Best Buy at a great price and figured why not? Maybe I got a lemon on the first one and if there is a problem, Best Buy is much easier to deal with.

It does do what I need it too and my kids says it runs most games pretty good. The only other thing is it is quite heavy, so for me sitting on the sofa and doing work on it isn't very comfortable.

"Can't say enough good things about this laptop. It games fantastically at 1080P. Of course it has the expansion port for the graphics amp if you want more performance. Easily upgraded to 32gb of RAM if needed. The new 6 core / 12 thread i7 makes short work of CAM & photoshop (way over kill for gaming!) Good screen. Not too bad in bloatware. trackpad is responsive. Keyboard is good (the steelseries on my old MSI was better, but it was terrible on cooling!). Only real downsides are weight and thickness - but both of these allow for the better thermals. This is a desktop replacement - not an ultrabook. Also note, under reported, but I added an additional two drives to this so I'm now running the original 256 boot, a 1tb steam ssd, a 250gb CAD/CAM scratch disk SSD, and a 2tb 2.5"" storage drive.

"I originally bought this to replace the Razer Blade 14. It is much quieter than the Razer Blade 14. I'd only recommend the Razer Blade 14 if you play with headphones. The Razer Blade Pro FHD you can play games without headphones, since you don't get that vacuum cleaner sound with the Razer Blade 14. However, the sound from the speakers are just OK, the bass could use some punch. 

Upgrading the mechanical hard drive to a 2.5"" SATA III 2TB SSD was easy and there appears to be another slot open for a second NVME drive. It would be really easy to keep an entire game library on this laptop. 

The 120 Hz screen is great. I didn't know what I was missing until I tried one. For older games you might have to limit the frame rate with something like RivaTuner, but it is worth the extra hassle. It works good with the Razer Core eGPU, but the Razer Core's fan for the power source whines like the Razer Blade 14 under load. You will want to get some noise cancelling headphones if you plan to use it with the Razer Core (though it's no fault of the laptop).

"Everything so far is great about this laptop, except for the wireless card. The wireless card driver that came installed on the laptop was not compatible with my wireless. I didn't find this out until after the initial setup of Windows 10, where updates were installed. This caused a critical error on the first boot and a BSOD. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A FIRST TIME BOOT ON AN EXPENSIVE SYSTEM. 

Thankfully, this issue didn't brick the OS and after about 10 minutes of frustration and trying to access the internet only to find that my wireless signal was continuously dropping. I had an ethernet cable handy and connected directly to the NIC, which fixed the issue immediately. A quick google search found the driver issue and the correct version of drivers and allowed me to fix the issue myself. 

I understand that the PC was newly out of the box and that everything needs to be installed/setup - no problem with that. But it would have been nice to know about the wireless issue before I ran the risk of screwing my entire OS with corrupted updates.

"At first I thought that runing games such as PubG and Rocket League would make it too hot so I bought a cooling fan table.

"I had been looking for a new laptop for over two years. My old one just couldn't keep up with ever growing college courses worth of work. I realized to get something that would last years and be semi-future proof I would need to get into the ultrabooks range. 

My old laptop was Dell and I just had a bad experience in total. The first hard drive (that came with the laptop) crashes. I lost everything, was able to fix it. Until it crashed again, tried to get it recovered. Turned out the total cost of maybe getting anything back would be buying an ultrabook, so the serious searching began. I was able to google and YouTube my way through buying a new hard drive, formatting it, installing windows and updating every driver. (Side note: I had called Dell customer service because my warranty was out they would have charged me 200 dollars just to see the issue.) 

I only mention this because the Dell XPS had caught my attention when it first came out but the price was exceptionally high and Razer had the same specs for hundreds cheaper. 

At this day and age, choosing between the ultrabook market is very nitpicky. A color, the hinge, the weight, etc. 

I looked at everything, Macs are far too expensive for what they offer. This same laptop with same internals would cost me almost another grand. The same is said for the Microsoft surface line. 

I've had the laptop for about a month now. The battery lasts me about eight hours (5+ window pages, Microsoft word, Spotify playing in the background, power point open and some YouTube videos.) The screen is not 4K but it is exceptionally beautiful and for a 13 inch 4K would be a bit excessive and eat away at the battery life. 

The keyboard may be shallow to some but key spaces are perfect, if you like quiet typing then this is perfect for that. Not much clicking but just enough. 

The track pad is smooth, not jumpy or staggering. Pinch to zoom in or out. There are not dedicated buttons to click but it does press down on the sides. 

The touch screen is responsive and really nothing to complain about, just a nice feature to have. 

The chroma lighting it's definitely a kicker, each key is individually lit and it's honestly the best out there. It looks very clean compared to others I've seen, doesn't hurt your eyes. Though I will say, the max brightness will make you feel like keys are moving. I don't think I see myself ever keeping the keys at max. 

The speed is amazing, boots up in seconds, loads any application just as quick. The SSD is able to open and save things smoothly as well. To push ultrabook to its limits definitely takes some dedication. 

Portability is amazing. Sits at 2.93 pounds. It's small, light and smooth. Opening it up only requires one hand and the bottom has two rubber lines for grip and they work fantastic at keeping the laptop in place while also giving room for the fans to have space. 

Finger print magnet though, anything will attach to the black metal finish. But I am one to put cases on everything and I just bought a matte black skin that just fits in with laptop, unnoticed and provides protection from everyday use. Nicks, scratches, etc. 

There is also the fact that this made by a company that makes gaming laptops, this stealth is not that. It's meant for productivity and it does that amazingly. There is the option of having an external GPU if gaming is an option you'd like. 

There is also a gunmetal grey version that provides are more subtle look, though the keyboard will not have chroma and the logo will not light up. 

This laptop is one of the few that has refreshed to the new 8th gen intel quad core processor which means even more effective and efficient power. 

The laptop under duress does get warm but nothing that's uncomfortable and the fans have no whirring sounds, as that was an issue before but has been fixed. 

Ultimately for my needs and wants this laptop was the perfect fit. The black was a refreshing to all the different greys out there. I can change the key color to whatever I want if I want a more professional look and the logo can be turned on or off. Performance is always top tier and if the eight hours seems short, this is USB-C charged, which means you can take a power bank and easily charge this for another added few hours. Which brings me to ports, compared to others this one is decent. USB-C, two thunderbolt 3 ports and HDMI port. 

Razer's cumtomer service is not the best so to sideline that, I went ahead and bought two years of warranty under Best Buy, that way if anything goes wrong I have peace of mind. (Had too many stressors before.) 

Razer also has a great line of peripherals that go well with there laptops, I bought a mouse and mouse pad from them.

I honestly couldn't be happier, like I said, it's one of the best. If you are in the ultrabook market you know that none of them are going to be cheap, this one is great for everything it offers and sales are always going on. I got 100 dollars off mine. 

Lastly, this model is different, this is the 13.3 inch, the 12.5 inch is different, don't confuse the two!

"I bought this because I wanted something small and lightweight to travel with and I was torn between this and the MacBook. For what you get in MacBook for the price I just couldn't justify paying more for less. All I can say is WOW! If your like me you might have been looking at razer products and found out there customer support is garbage, which may be true. I opted to get one through Best Buy so I would have the extended return period and could purchase the geek squad protection. I am truly glad I purchased this laptop. I actually drove to a store 2 hours away to pick it up because no stores in MS had any. The screen is beautiful, its super quite and doesn't really get that hot unless your pushing it, but still its not so hot you cant sit it in you lap. I will admit the first thing I did is load up prime 95 and xtu and ran some tests and this laptop only thermal throttled right off the batt for like a second when it turbo boosted to 4GHZ on the cores. After that it fell back to around 2ghz which the core clock is 1.8ghz and sat there at around 70C on the processors. This is not designed for gaming don't misunderstand, but it is a great laptop for work, and non gaming entertainment, that's built like a brick but lightweight, beautiful to look at and fun to use.

"Where do I start? I've been with Apple for 10 years and run both of my business purely from my electronic devices. I bought the brand new Macbook Pro, full specs, and it broke within two weeks. Two of the keys got stuck, the screen was glitchy, battery life wasn't amazing.... not cool for $2000+. I took the plunge and gave windows a try after being fed up with declining quality of apple products. I bought this computer, pretty much expecting not to like it and take it right back... whoa. I LOVE this thing. It has twice the specs of an introductory macbook pro, a FASTER processor, a better screen (touch), and the number one reason I bought this computer, the keyboard!

"======= Summary =======

The Legion Y530 is a well-designed and performant laptop with only one shortcoming - no SSD hard drive. The build is great, the thin-bezel display is awesome, it contains great components, and is a pleasure to use everyday. With its easy upgradeability, the Y530 will offer many years of service for most people.

*Pro's:

1. Thin display bezels.
2. Relatively light and thin for a gaming laptop.
3. Excellent keyboard and touchpad.
4. Good design & build quality (despite being plastic).
5. Good selection of ports.
6. Decent gaming performance thanks to the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU.
7. Easy access to internals for system upgrade.
8. Minimal amount of bloatware. Easily removable.

*Con's:

1. Slower than a system with a SSD drive.
2. No Thunderbolt 3.


======= Design & Build Quality =======

There are lots of thing I like about the design and build quality of the Legion Y530. For a gaming laptop, it's relatively light at ~5 lbs and pretty thin. 

The laptop is all black and looks like a serious machine - no blingy red LED's and no flamboyant design curves, angular lines, or flourishes. I appreciate the toned-down design and subtlety.

The parts of the laptop that you interact with the most feel nice despite being made of all plastic. The lid has a nice texture and radial pattern to it that makes the Legion look and feel different from other typical plastic laptops. Stains are easily resisted and cleaning up is simple and quick. The glowing white LED that illuminates the ""Y"" symbol inside the letter O is also very cool without being garish.

The hinge is well-designed and enables one to easily open the lid with just one finger. It is also firm & sturdy and holds up the screen very well. 

Also nice is the soft-touch keyboard base, the smooth touchpad, and the textured touchpad buttons. The keyboard buttons with their ""just-right"" travel distance and responsiveness lead to comfortable typing and gaming experiences. The keyboard has white LED backlighting with two different brightness levels (FN + Spacebar to toggle between Brightness Level 1, Level 2, and Off). I LOVE that the backlighting doesn't turn off automatically after some idle time (Acer take note~!). 

Despite lacking aluminum and not being ""premium"", I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 for design & build quality. 


======= Display =======

The 1920x1080 Full HD 15.6"" matte display, surrounded by those thin bezels, is quite nice. At normal viewing distance, everything is crispy and clear. For general-purpose web viewing and gaming, the display is perfectly adequate and appropriate. It doesn't get very bright at 250 nits but I'm satisfied.

I LOVE how I can lift the lid with just one finger and how the display can be pushed back up to 180 degrees.


======= Speakers =======

The speakers sound nice and full with its Harman Kardon speakers with Dolby Audio tuning. Compared to skinny ultrabooks, such as my HP Spectre 13, the Legion Y530's speakers sound louder, fuller, more dynamic, and has a wider soundstage. Bass, of course, is weak but that is to be expected from a laptop. Listening to music and playing games was more than satisfactory and enjoyable.


======= Network & Connectivity Options =======

The Legion Y530 comes equipped with Realtek PCI Express Gigabit ethernet and Realtek 8822BE 802.11AC Wifi. I experienced no connectivity or connection speed issues. Everything was peachy. 


======= Ports =======

A healthy number and types of ports are offered - 3x USB 3.0 Type A, 1x USB Type C Gen 1, 1x ethernet, 1x HDMI, and 1x mini-Display port. The ports suit my needs perfectly and I have no complaints. For my personal usage, not having a Thunderbolt port is not a loss. 


======= Performance =======

The performance of the Legion Y530 has been a mixed bag for me. Due to its traditional 7200 RPM HDD (1TB Seagate BarraCuda Pro), the laptop boots slow (53 seconds to Windows log-in prompt from cold boot) and Windows 10 initialization is laggy. It took 2 minutes before I could start launching my Chrome browser. App installations take relatively long times compared to systems with a SSD hard drive. Same for Windows 10 updates.

Fortunately, things do get better later on. Once Windows 10 has been fully initialized and all the background processes have been completed, the laptop kicks in and begins to perform very well. With Intel's 8th-generation Coffee Lake 8750H processor (6-core, 12-thread) and 8GB of DDR4-2666 RAM, the Legion Y530 pushes through everything effortlessly. I had no issues multitasking with Chrome (~25 tabs), Word, and YouTube.

Gaming is executed smoothly as well as long as you don't crank up all the in-game settings to Very High or Ultra (dependent on the game, of course). In order to experience the full potential of the Legion Y530, one has to be plugged in and change the Power Options to ""High Performance"" inside the Windows Mobility Center. Otherwise, games don't run very well, especially on just battery power. Besides, the battery would quickly run down to empty in about an hour anyways without the charger.

I mainly played 3 games on the Legion - Far Cry 5 (2018), Deus Ex Mankind Divided (2016), and Rise of the Tomb Raider (2016). The Rise of the Tomb Raider ran the best and allowed me to turn on most of the graphics settings to High. I obtained the following results in the in-game benchmark test:

-Mountain Peak: 54.32 FPS (min: 25.32, max: 110.61)
-Syria: 48.83 FPS (min: 3.11, max: 86.88)
-Geothermal Valley: 43.04 FPS (min: 5.39, max: 93.04)
-Overall score: 48.48 FPS

Deus Ex Mankind Divided was harder on the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. In order to get smooth frames, I had to lower the quality settings quite a bit to this:

-Texture Quality: Low
-Texture Filtering: Off
-Shadow Quality: Medium
-Contact Hardening Shadows: Off
-Temporal Anti-Aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On
-Depth of Field: Off
-Bloom: Off
-Volumetric Lighting: Off
-Subsurface Scattering: Off
-Sharpen: On

Playing Far Cry 5 was a lot better and I was able to play smoothly with these settings:

-Texture Filtering: High
-Shadows: Normal
-Geometry & Vegetation: Normal
-Environment: Normal
-Water: Normal
-Terrain: Normal
-Volumetric Fog: Low
-Anti-aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On

On Geekbench 4.2.3, the Y530 scored 4664 Single-core and 15,197 Multi-core. It performed better than my Samsung Notebook 9 Pro with an Intel Core i7 7500U dual-core CPU (4189 Single-core, 8503 Multi-core) and my HP Spectre 13 with an Intel Core i7 8550U 4-core CPU (4666 Single-core, 12,051 Multi-core).

If this Legion Y530 had come with a SSD drive or at least an Intel Optane Memory accelerator, then the overall performance and smoothness of the machine would've been so much better. It's a shame Lenovo cut corners and instead included such a slow spinning hard drive. On the bright side, the prices of the SSD drives have come down greatly and it is easy enough to add one later.

*Pro-Tip: After I formatted the Windows drive and freshly installed Windows 10, the Legion Y530 became noticeably more responsive and faster. It's still not as fast as having a SSD drive but the improvement was quite eye-opening. For even more speed, I will be investing in a NVME PCI-Express SSD hard drive shortly to use as my Windows drive.


======= Keyboard & TouchPad =======

As mentioned earlier, both the keyboard and touchpad on the Legion Y530 are excellent. The keys have good travel distance, are responsive, and very comfortable for long-term typing and gaming. I also LOVE the full-sized Arrow Keys and the spacious Number Pad area. My only slight gripe is not having dedicated PgUp & PgDn buttons (you have to use the Fn + Arrow Keys).

The Touchpad is accurate and responsive to use thanks to Microsoft's Precision driver. Setting up custom touchpad gestures is easy and it works very well. The touchpad buttons make a clickity sound but not to the point of being annoying. My Legion's touchpad buttons didn't sound as loud as it did in some YouTube reviews I saw. 

I rate both of them 10 out of 10.


======= Battery Life =======

For a gaming laptop, the battery life I experienced has been excellent. When I'm just browsing the web and not gaming, I can get about 4 to 5 hours of battery life at 80% brightness. During gaming, however, it will last just about 1 hour. 


======= Software =======

The Legion Y530 comes with a minimal amout of bloatware. I counted 3 Lenovo apps, 5 third-party games, and some Microsoft apps such as Xbox and Skype. Compared to other manufacturers' bloatware (e.g., Dell, HP), the Legion Y530 comes packed pretty clean. Windows 10 was at version 1709 and I updated to the latest 1803 Build 17134.191 without a hitch.


======= Upgradeability =======

The Legion Y530 offers several options for future component upgrades - DDR4 memory, SATA3 hard drive (HDD or SSD), Wifi module, and PCI-Express NVME M.2 2280 SSD hard drive. To upgrade, one removes 11 Philips screws from the bottom of the laptop and pop off the bottom cover. The bottom cover is held on by numerous plastic tabs so be gentle when popping the cover off to not break them.

I HIGHLY recommend everyone to purchase a NVME M.2 2280 SSD drive and install it to greatly increase system responsiveness and performance. 


======= My Verdict =======

The Legion Y530 is a good value entry-level gaming laptop with a great design, slim-bezel display, awesome keyboard and touchpad, great audio, and very decent hardware (6-core Intel Core i7, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GPU). Its only weakness is the slow traditional spinning hard drive. Either replace it with a SATA SSD hard drive or add an NVME M.2 2280 SSD hard drive and you'll be all set for a smooth and fast computing & gaming experience.",optimummind,Greating value gaming laptop with great design,11,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",4
"Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0001US)

Setup/Testing/Conclusion

The Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0001US). Packed with an Intel i7 8750H, 8GB DDR4 2666 memory, and an Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. Let’s go ahead and dive right in and see how this budget Gaming Laptop performs.

Right off the bat, the Intel i7 8750H is an excellent CPU. You’re looking at the successor to the widely popular Intel i7 7700HQ which is what was used a lot in previous gaming laptops. With the Intel i7 8750H, you’re going to be getting about a 10% increase in single core performance and about a 15 ~ 25% increase in multi-core performance. The Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti isn’t the fastest or considered a “high end” GPU, but it’s definitely considered as one of the best (if not the best) budget GPU. This specific version of the Lenovo Legion Y530 only comes with 8GB of memory and a traditional mechanical hard drive. So before I even ran any games, my expectations weren’t going to be through the roof. I mean we’re looking at a budget gaming rig here, not a top of the line gaming beast. So now that we got that out the way, let’s go ahead and see what this combo brings to the table.

As expected, this specific Lenovo Legion Y530 performs decent. As mentioned previously, it’s not going to be the fastest out there; but it’s definitely not the slowest. So if you’re looking to play everything on ultra presets and expect incredible frames per second, I would probably invest in a pretty high end gaming rig. If you’re looking to play games on a combination of low ~ medium presets, you’ll be just fine with this Lenovo Legion Y530 model. I was able to run games like Counter-Strike Global Offensive (140 FPS), Battlefield 1 (60 FPS), Tom Clancy’s The Division (60 FPS), GTA V (55 FPS), and Diablo 3 (95 FPS) without any FPS drops. I did for a weird reason encounter micro stutters/skips while gaming though.

With the Legion Y530, I didn’t have a problem taking it around. Because of it’s subtle and sleek design, it doesn’t scream “GAMING”; yet it doesn’t look like an ordinary laptop. I personally enjoy the black design and look of the laptop. Although the Y530 is made majority of plastic, it's still quite durable and still looks good. Lenovo changed the backlit keyboard from red to white which looks a lot better. The bezels around the screen (left, top, and right) are also quite thin compared to the last years model. Because of the thin bezel change, the webcam was moved to below the screen. So if you plan on using the webcam, be prepared to show off your nose and in addition to the other party seeing your knuckles a lot if you're typing. But, I’ll definitely make that trade any day; smaller bezels vs having the camera at the top. If you currently own the last year’s model, you’ll also notice that a lot of the ports have been placed in the back of the laptop. You’ll still have access to a USB 3.1 port on either side of the laptop. The reason for this is so that it offers better cooling. Overall, the thermals on the Y530 is pretty decent. When gaming, the CPU did get pretty hot (95c ~ 97c) while the GPU didn’t really heat up that much. The fans do get quite loud under load so make sure you have some headphones on. When it comes to the picture/screen quality, I wasn’t as impressed. I wished it was a bit brighter and the color reproduction was better. So if you were to use the Y530 in a more lit environment, you may have some difficulty viewing the screen. The 52.5Wh 3-cell lithium ion battery lasted about 4 hours with my usage which is typically expected with these type of setups. If you’re gaming on it constantly, the battery probably won’t last as long as 4 hours. So be prepared to bring your charger with you! 

Here are a couple breakdown of pros and cons that I would like to mention as my own opinion:
Pros:

Very sleek at subtle design
No bloatware
Decent all around performance

Cons:
Display (not as bright as others and colors are a bit spongy)
Why GTX 1050 Ti? Would've liked to see at least a 1060. Lenovo also offers a 144Hz screen so it only makes sense to have a more powerful GPU… 
Wished battery lasted longer

In conclusion, this Lenovo Legion Y530 has pretty decent all around performance. I didn’t experience any frame rate drops during gaming but did experience micro stutters. My settings on average were around low ~ medium (Nvidia Presets/Recommended). I would’ve liked to see Lenovo release all Legion Y530 with a GTX 1060 and a SSD by default (as this specific model comes with a traditional mechanical hard drive). I know they have other models but from what I could find; GTX 1050 Ti is all they have currently. Overall, I would give this specific model 3 out of 5 stars. Lenovo did do an excellent job by ditching the red and making the Legion Y530 very sleek (excellent redesign Lenovo!). Where it falls short on this specific model is with the traditional mechanical hard drive and the GTX 1050 Ti. Because of no SSD, the boot times and load times are pretty excruciating. I would say that if you’re on a really tight budget, this specific model may be for you. But if you’re able to dish out some more money for the version with an SSD, I would definitely recommend that.

Various Manuals",MarkusKong,Excellent Redesign. This Model Could be Improved.,5,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",3
"Design:
The Lenovo Legion Y530 is a powerful laptop with a sleek design. This is my first gaming laptop, mostly because I had not found a good hybrid between gaming power and portability until now. I find it to be just thin and light enough to consider it portable, which is great because I am on the go quite often. Although color scheme is not a priority of mine, I like the subtle black exterior with a white illuminated keyboard and logo on the lid. Most of the ports are on the back of the laptop, the impressively effective fans are underneath, and the power button is in the middle above the keyboard. Typing and using the various keys on the keyboard is easy thanks to the sufficient spacing and key size. My only complaint is that the touchpad feels a bit awkward to use due to the location, size, and left/right click buttons instead of a touchpad that clicks down, but that feeling has improved as I have gotten used to it. However, while at home, I prefer to use a mouse. Overall, I think the Lenovo Legion Y530 is a well-designed laptop. 

Features:
The speakers are good, but I have heard better quality sound on several other similar laptops. If you usually use headphones, this may not matter much, but I was expecting better sound quality, especially since it is highlighted as a feature of this Lenovo Legion Y530. The HD webcam is very clear, so I have no complaints there. Since this is a gaming laptop, there is plenty of memory, a powerful processor, and great graphics. Even standard use, such as browsing the internet or watching videos, is enjoyable due to the speed and quality of the content displayed on the screen. The battery lasts quite a while for a gaming laptop, but it does not last me the whole day if I use the laptop frequently. However, the battery does charge relatively quickly. I think you get a lot of great features with this laptop.

Gaming:
With impressive graphics and lots of processing power, gaming sessions on this laptop are fantastic. I have experienced nothing but smooth gameplay, and the graphics are great on all the games that I have played. Connecting to Wi-Fi was a breeze, and the connection has always remained stable and fast, even during online games that require a lot of bandwidth. As a longtime gamer, I am impressed and would definitely recommend this laptop to fellow gamers. 

Verdict:
The Lenovo Legion Y530 is the perfect blend of power and portability for gaming and everyday use. As opposed to other gaming laptops with flashy designs and colors, I like the subtlety and sleekness of this laptop. Processing power is not compromised due to the compact design, and my gaming sessions on this laptop have not disappointed me. Although it is not perfect in all aspects, if you are looking for a gaming laptop that is also great for everyday use, then look no further. I recommend the Lenovo Legion Y530 to others with confidence.",Kelby,"Finally, Power and Portability in a Gaming Laptop",2,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",5
"I had this laptop for a week and so far this thing is pretty good. It is light compared to other laptop at 5 pounds. Since, the screen has small bezel, the laptop has smaller footprint. 

Screen : The screen is good compared to my brother's Dell G7. The brightness is around 255 nits which is higher than the G7. It is fairly sharper display. It is good enough for gaming.And, it does look good because of smaller bezel of the display.

Hard Drive: It has 7200rpm hard drive which is very slower compared to normal SSD. If you are custom to ssd speed, you would absolutely hate the first day of this laptop. The windows update took literally 5 hours to download and install. It did became fairly faster after that. You would also hear the hard drive spinning. You can replace with 2.5 inch sata SSD. There is also a 25 GB M.2 SSD which has bunch of drivers. So, you have two storage options. 

Processor and GPU: Bestbuy model has i7 not the i5. This processor is really fast compared to last gen intel processor. But, it also runs extremely hot. To be honest, this processor is overkill for gaming because you would have to under volt the processor to make it run cool. The throttling is there but its surprising minimal in my cpu stress test. The CPU temps did reach around 97C while gaming. You can use the Lenovo software to run the fan in higher speed and get the temps down little bit. The fan noise is alright, not that loud. But the laptop does get very hot, especially at the bottom.

The GPU is 1050ti. It is good enough for casual gamer like me who play games occasionally. It runs recent titles like Battlefield 1, Far cry 5 at respectable frame rates. It's a entry level gaming card, so you know what you getting into.

Battery life: The laptop has 52watt battery which is really small because of higher wattage processor and GPU. I get around 3 to 4 hours of YouTube videos and web surfing. It would only last 2 1/2 hours with full brightness. If you game in battery, it would run for an hour. 

Conclusion: It is very powerful laptop but lenovo has to cut on battery capacity and display to price in this range. If you are happy with the 1050ti, then it is a good buy as it is in $50 sale right now. The six core i7 processor can handle anything. As a engineer, I use this laptop to run Auto-cad and solid-works and this thing is just perfect for my needs. Replace the hard drive with ssd, then you have a very capable machine.",IEEE,GOOD for the price BUT.....,1,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",4
"With an entry level price.
If you’re looking to step up your game, or should I say gaming a bit and keep the bucks under a cool $1000.00 price point this may be just the computer for you.
It’s not glitzy and alien-ish looking with glowing symbols and lights. 
Instead it’s a rather unassuming normal looking computer in classic black. 
It really smokes the more casual games with a lower FPS rate but chugs along a bit on higher graphic games like Hitman etc., and not a top choice for VR gaming either. 
The Harmon Kardon speakers are fantastic for everything from special effects to music. 
Love the fact that its a lighted keyboard with more of an easy touch keyboard, but many don’t like that in a gaming laptop and prefer the sharp snap of a more stiff keyboard, but I like it.
The huge 1TB hybrid can handle nearly anything that you throw at it by utilizing the SSD for the opsys and the SATA handles a ton data storage with ease.
The display is really good, showing a great deal of detail that adds to your gaming enjoyment.
The cooling fans keep this from overheating while you’re putting it thru the paces of rigorous game play. 
The case itself is plastic, as it is on every laptop I have owned so far but seems to be very durable. 
I went ahead and added another bank of ram to bump it up to 16 GB of ram but have not had the chance to get in a good session of game playing since the upgrade. 
The entire back has to be removed and another metal plate needs to be removed after removing the battery, which must be done after removing the back, but disassembly and reassembly was relatively easy and was completed without hitting even the first snag.
I was a bit disappointed in the fact the Y530 does not have a CD Drive, but only $40.00 for an external and I was a happy camper. 
Bottom Line:
Great Buy For An Entry Level Gaming Laptop for some of the easier lower graphic demanding games.",PapawJeff,Entry Level Gaming PC,1,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",4
"The Y530 is a budget gaming laptop. With anything budget, you need to make some compromises. The compromises here include: weight, awkward position of the webcam, and battery life.

I find the Y530 a bit too heavy to want to carry it around with me unless I absolutely have to. While the GTX1050ti allows you to game, the battery life definitely suffers. The biggest annoyance I had with the laptop is the webcam's position. The angle is aimed in such a way that will be looking up your nose!

With the bad out of the way, I can say the 8gb of ram and the GTX 1050ti are reasonable specs for anyone looking fopr a gaming/photo editing laptop. The Y530 DOESN'T scream gamer, and I enjoy all of the main ports (charger, ethernet, etc). The backlit keyboard and track pad worked well, but I don't think anyone will be raving over them.

"This is my 2nd go on a Razer system and I was hoping that this will be different than the my Blade Stealth which had severe phantom touch issues. 


Charger - The build on this laptop is amazing and my favorite of all the current laptops out so far. Feels nice and sturdy and looks sleek BUT, after using the laptop for a few days, I start to notice some crackling sounds while doing some light Photoshop work. The sound is loud enough to hear even though I was listening to music with headphones on. I take a look around and hear loud buzzing and crackling from the charging unit like its about to pop and catch fire. I immediately unplug the charger and contact Razer's customer service to replace the unit. After going back and fourth with them, they agree to send me a new charging unit, but it will take 5-7 business days to receive AFTER I send my current one back. That means I'd be without power for a little over a week. That's fine, but I use the Blade for work and need power for the laptop. They will NOT send a charger ahead of time so be prepared to be out of a computer for over a week. Paying such a premium price for this laptop, I would expect the urgency and support to be a little better..

Synapse - One of the reasons for me getting this laptop is its amazing keyboard and the ability to customize the colors through Razer's Synapse app. Customizing colors for shortcuts on certain apps would be very beneficial to me. Only problem is, the app does not work! I have a non-functioning light keyboard. As I am typing this review, only 1/3 of my keyboard is lit up. I tried numerous times to open the Synapse app, but it continues to close it self. It closes itself so fast, I can't even uninstall it.

Color Accuracy - Another reason I purchased this laptop is because of their claim of 100% SRGB. Since I do a lot of photo work, this was very important to me. After checking calibration, it only hits 97% using the Datacolor Spyder5 Pro calibration tool. It's not too big of a deal since I can always use my calibrated monitors at home, but it is a little disappointing.

Battery Life - Not too great, but expectations were low to begin with. About 3 hours of some lite web browsing and its out. 

Final thoughts - If there weren't any issues within the first few days of owning the laptop, I'd feel more confident owning it. I feel like after a year, something will definitely go wrong and I'd have to spend another couple grand for a laptop. 

 If you are looking for a laptop to use for work, the Blade is probably not for you. You will be out of a laptop for a week at some point due to some charger failure and if you have projects due, you will be screwed. Now I am not the only one with the issue so please be advised before purchasing the laptop.",Jesse,"Nicely built, HORRIBLE charger, and Synapse",12,6,"Razer - Blade 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",1
"This is my first experience with Razer. I have always loved the looks of their laptops and other products (external GPU enclosure looks great too), and I also like the idea of a company that's ""for gamers, by gamers,"" and takes in to consideration all of the feedback they receive from their customers to improve their products. For those things, 5 stars.

I recently decided to dive back in to the world of a gaming laptop after having ASUS, Aorus, MSI, and other brands in the past, and after seeing how sexy the 2018 Blade 15.6 was, I decided to go that route. The same or better performance can be had for much less (BB currently has an ASUS with the same CPU, same RAM, a REAL 1060 vs the 1060 Max-Q in the Blade, etc. for $1299 vs $2199 for the Blade), but the Blade has better build quality, is almost bezeless, and just seems to be built very well. I forked over the $900 premium for the ""look and feel"" and was very happy with my purchase, until 3 days later when the charger started making noise.

After coming in the third morning of ownership and powering up the laptop, I could hear what can only be described as the sound of a mechanical hard drive under heavy load. Lots of pops and clicks and whatnot. Since the Blade doesn't have a mechanical drive, I started looking around to find where the sound was coming from. It was electrical cracks and pops from the charger. Great. 3 days in, $2199 laptop, and the charger sounds like it's going to fail.

I got on chat with Razer customer support. After filling out a form and taking a video of the power supply so the support rep could hear what was happening, he said ""Yep! The sound is very audible, we'll be replacing your unit."" I had to fill out another form, and then he said ""The order for the replacement unit will be processed after tracking info tells us that your old unit is on its way back to us."" Wait, what? I asked how long that would take, since I'd obviously be without a laptop the entire time. He said ""To process and ship the order usually takes 2 business days, and shipping is 3-5 business days."" (So, they're shipping it Ground).

At that point I told him that I use this laptop for work, and I couldn't be without it for, best case scenario, 5-7 business days. He told me to hold on and see what he could do. He came back with an offer of ""expedited"" 2-3 day shipping. Unacceptable.

Razer - You are selling a premium product. Please provide a premium service. After taking serial numbers off of my laptop and charger, and requiring I send in a proof of purchase as well as a video of the problem in question, you should have no doubt that I indeed own the laptop that's having the issue. Why not send a charger to me with a return label in the box so I can just stick my old charger in the box and send it back? If you don't trust your customers, I would have even been willing to provide a credit card number so you could charge me for the new one if I didn't return the old one.

Just because I can't be dark for a week or more, I'll be returning this laptop. I've read horror stories of Razer's support policies before, and I always hoped it was people being overly critical. Looks like I was wrong. It's a shame because I love the laptop itself, other than the fans that never seem to calm down even when I'm not gaming. Beautiful piece of kit other than the charger, and the customer support.

"I have been in the market for a ""Stealth"" gaming laptop for some time; something that doesn't stand out visually in a crowd as a gaming laptop but can still push out serious power. I had originally purchased a Surface Book 2, but I had many problems with the hardware, since it isn't a dedicated gaming computer. Since purchasing the Razer Blade 15 I have had zero regrets. 

Positives: It handles all of my games and software with ease. It has not crashed, slowed down, or showed signs of faulty hardware. It is a beautiful device, and receives compliments when used in public. Very portable and light, easily fits inside backpacks or bags.

Negatives: The power brick has a slight wine to it, but after looking on forums it is said to slowly go away over time. The fans can also get pretty loud under heavy gaming sessions, but the speakers easily play over them and headphones remove the issue entirely. Bottom of the laptop also gets hot while gaming so make sure to use it on a desk.

"Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US)

Setup/Testing/Conclusion

The Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US). Packed with an Intel i7 8750H, 16GB DDR4 2666 memory, 16GB Intel Optane Memory, and an Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. Let’s go ahead and dive right in and see how this Gaming Laptop performs.

Right off the bat, the Intel i7 8750H is an excellent CPU. You’re looking at the successor to the widely popular Intel i7 7700HQ which is what was used a lot in previous gaming laptops. With the Intel i7 8750H, you’re going to be getting about a 10% increase in single core performance and about a 15 ~ 25% increase in multi-core performance. The Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti isn’t the fastest nor is it considered a “high end” GPU, but it’s definitely considered as one of the best (if not the best) budget GPU. So before I even ran any games, my expectations weren’t going to be through the roof as I know it won’t perform like my desktop which contains an Intel i7-8700 and a GTX 1070. I mean we’re looking at a budget gaming rig here, not a top of the line gaming beast. So now that we got that out the way, let’s go ahead and see what this combo brings to the table.

CS:GO - 140 FPS
Tom Clancy’s The Division - 60 FPS
Battlefield 1 - 60 FPS
GTA V - 55 FPS
Diablo 3 - 95 FPS

As expected, this specific Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US) performs quite well. As mentioned previously, it’s not going to be the fastest out there; but it’s definitely not the slowest. So if you’re looking to play everything on ultra presets and expect incredible frames per second, I would probably invest in a pretty high end gaming rig. If you’re looking to play games on low/medium ~ high presets (Nvidia Recommended Settings), you’ll be just fine with this specific Lenovo Legion Y530. AAA titles will always demand a high performance machine. But with a gaming laptop, you’ll be able to bring it around with ease compared to a gaming desktop.

With the Legion Y530, I didn’t have a problem taking it around. Because of it’s subtle and sleek design, it doesn’t scream “GAMING”; yet it doesn’t look like an ordinary laptop. I personally enjoy the black design and look of the laptop. Although the Y530 is made majority of plastic, it's still quite durable and still looks good. Lenovo changed the backlit keyboard from red to white which looks a lot better. The bezels around the screen (left, top, and right) are also quite thin compared to the last years model. Because of the thin bezel change, the webcam was moved to below the screen. So if you plan on using the webcam, be prepared to show off your nose and in addition to the other party seeing your knuckles a lot if you're typing. But, I’ll definitely make that trade any day; smaller bezels vs having the camera at the top. If you currently own the last year’s model, you’ll also notice that a lot of the ports have been placed in the back of the laptop. You’ll still have access to a USB 3.1 port on either side of the laptop. The reason for this is so that it offers better cooling. Overall, the thermals on the Y530 is pretty good under normal usage. During my gaming session it does get warm but what gaming laptop doesn’t? I did see temps hit around 95c (MAX) but the fans would ramp up and keep the temps under control. The fans aren’t silent but they aren’t super loud either; I would classify the fan noise as expected/average. When it comes to the picture/screen quality, I wasn’t as impressed. I wished it was a bit brighter and the color reproduction was better. So if you were to use the Y530 in a more lit environment, you may have some difficulty viewing the screen. The 52.5Wh 3-cell lithium ion battery will last about 4 hours with general usage which is typically expected with these type of setups. But if you game on it, the battery will last about 1 ~ 1.5 hours. So be prepared to bring your charger with you! 

Here are a couple breakdown of pros and cons that I would like to mention as my own opinion:
Pros:

Very sleek at subtle design
No bloatware
Solid all around good performance
Fan control

Cons:
Display (not as bright as others and color reproduction isn’t as good)
Why GTX 1050 Ti? Would've liked to see at least a 1060 as Lenovo did an excellent job on the chassis. Lenovo also offers a 144Hz screen so it only makes sense to have a more powerful GPU… 
Wished battery lasted longer

In conclusion, this Lenovo Legion Y530 has pretty good all around performance. I didn’t experience any frame rate drops during gaming. My settings on average were around low/medium ~ high (Nvidia Presets/Recommended). I would’ve liked to see Lenovo release all Legion Y530 with a GTX 1060 and a SSD by default (as this specific model comes with a traditional mechanical hard drive and Intel Optane Memory). I know they have other models but from what I could find; GTX 1050 Ti is all they have currently. Overall, I would give this specific model a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. Lenovo did do an excellent job by ditching the red and making the Legion Y530 very sleek (excellent redesign Lenovo!). Where it falls short on this specific model is with the GTX 1050 Ti and the picture/screen quality. Although this specific model didn’t come with an SSD, the Intel Optane Memory did in fact help with boot/load times. This specific Lenovo Legion Y530 is definitely worth being stated as an excellent budget gaming laptop. If you’re able to get the one with an SSD, I’m sure it’ll be even faster. Overall, thoroughly impressed with the this Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US).

======= Design & Build Quality =======

For a gaming laptop at this price point, the Legion Y530 is relatively light (~5 lbs) and pretty thin, even good for students and other portable users.

The laptop is all black and looks like a serious machine - no blingy accent lights with flamboyant design curves and lines. I appreciate the toned-down design and subtlety.

The parts of the laptop that you interact with the most feel nice despite being made of all plastic. The lid has a nice texture and radial pattern to it that makes the Legion look and feel different from other typical plastic laptops. Stains are easily resisted and cleaning up is simple and quick. The glowing white LED that illuminates the ""Y"" symbol inside the letter O is also very cool without being garish.

The hinge is well-designed and enables one to easily open the lid with just one finger. It is also firm & sturdy and holds up the screen very well. 

Also nice is the soft-touch keyboard base, the smooth touchpad, and the textured touchpad buttons. The keyboard buttons with their ""just-right"" travel distance and responsiveness lead to comfortable typing and gaming experiences. The keyboard has white LED backlighting with two different brightness levels (FN + Spacebar to toggle between Brightness Level 1, Level 2, and Off). I LOVE that the backlighting doesn't turn off automatically after some idle time (Acer take note~!). 

Despite lacking aluminum and not being ""premium"", I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 for design & build quality. 


======= Display =======

The 1920x1080 Full HD 15.6"" matte display, surrounded by those thin bezels, is quite nice. At normal viewing distance, everything is crispy and clear. For general-purpose web viewing and gaming, the display is perfectly adequate and appropriate. It doesn't get very bright at 250 nits but I'm satisfied.

I LOVE how I can lift the lid with just one finger and how the display can be pushed back up to 180 degrees.


======= Speakers =======

The speakers sound nice and full with its Harman Kardon speakers with Dolby Audio tuning. Compared to skinny ultrabooks, such as my HP Spectre 13, the Legion Y530's speakers sound louder, fuller, more dynamic, and has a wider soundstage. Bass, of course, is weak but that is to be expected from a laptop. Listening to music and playing games was more than satisfactory and enjoyable.


======= Network & Connectivity Options =======

The Legion Y530 comes equipped with the Realtek PCI Express Gigabit ethernet and the excellent Intel Wireless-AC 9560 802.11AC Gigabit Wifi. Also included in the Intel package is Bluetooth 5.0 which is forward-looking and up-to-date. I experienced no connectivity or connection speed issues. Everything was peachy. 


======= Ports =======

A healthy number and type of ports are offered - 3x USB 3.1 Type A, 1x USB Type C Gen 1, 1x ethernet, 1x HDMI, and 1x mini-Display port. The ports suit my needs perfectly and I have no complaints. For my personal usage, not having a Thunderbolt port is not a loss. 


======= Performance =======

The performance of the Legion Y530 is excellent due to its quality and well-balanced components (Intel Core i7 8th-Gen Coffee Lake CPU with 6 Cores, 16GB DDR4-2666 RAM, 1TB Seagate 7200RPM HDD, 16GB Intel Optane Memory, and nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB).

Windows 10 boots up relatively fast despite having a spinning HDD (thanks to Intel Optane Memory), programs install and load very quickly, and there is no jankiness or lag. It is AMAZING how much of a performance difference that stick of Intel Optane Memory makes in really speeding up the system and smoothing everything out.

Even when compared to my HP Spectre 13 with a faster 1TB Samsung 960 Evo PCI-E SSD, the Legion Y530 boots up almost as fast and loads my apps very quickly. Intel Optane is no marketing gimmick - it works as advertised and makes a very noticeable difference in system responsiveness and speed. Thanks to Intel Optane, I personally don't see a need to upgrade to a SSD drive - at least not for a while.

Wit 16GB of RAM, I naturally had no issues at multitasking - Google Chrome (~25 tabs), Word, YouTube, background file transfers and downloads. Only one scenario introduced a little bit of lag and that was when I was doing the following: Chrome brower with about 10 tabs, Steam client downloading 3 games in the background, and torrenting 3 files (each with about 5 GB in size). Still not bad for a system without a SSD drive.

Gaming is executed smoothly as long as you don't crank up all the in-game settings to Very High or Ultra (dependent on the game, of course). In order to experience the full potential of the Legion Y530, one has to be plugged in and change the Power Options to ""High Performance"" inside the Windows Mobility Center. Otherwise, games don't run very well, especially on just battery power. Besides, the battery would quickly run down to empty in about an hour anyways without the charger.

I mainly played 3 games on the Legion - Far Cry 5 (2018), Deus Ex Mankind Divided (2016), and Rise of the Tomb Raider (2016). The Rise of the Tomb Raider ran the best and allowed me to turn on most of the graphics settings to High and still average above 48 frames per second.

Deus Ex Mankind Divided was much harder on the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. In order to get smooth frames, I had to lower the quality settings quite a bit to this:

-Texture Quality: Low
-Texture Filtering: Off
-Shadow Quality: Medium
-Contact Hardening Shadows: Off
-Temporal Anti-Aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On
-Depth of Field: Off
-Bloom: Off
-Volumetric Lighting: Off
-Subsurface Scattering: Off
-Sharpen: On

Playing Far Cry 5 was a lot better and I was able to play smoothly with these settings:

-Texture Filtering: High
-Shadows: Normal
-Geometry & Vegetation: Normal
-Environment: Normal
-Water: Normal
-Terrain: Normal
-Volumetric Fog: Low
-Anti-aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On

On Geekbench 4.2.3, the Y530 scored 4664 Single-core and 15,197 Multi-core. It performed better than my Samsung Notebook 9 Pro with an Intel Core i7 7500U dual-core CPU (4189 Single-core, 8503 Multi-core) and my HP Spectre 13 with an Intel Core i7 8550U 4-core CPU (4666 Single-core, 12,051 Multi-core).

======= Keyboard & TouchPad =======

As mentioned earlier, both the keyboard and touchpad on the Legion Y530 are excellent. The keys have good travel distance, are responsive, and very comfortable for long-term typing and gaming. I also LOVE the full-sized Arrow Keys and the spacious Number Pad area. My only slight gripe is not having dedicated PgUp & PgDn buttons (you have to use the Fn + Arrow Keys).

The Touchpad is accurate and responsive to use thanks to Microsoft's Precision driver. Setting up custom touchpad gestures is easy and it works very well. The touchpad buttons make a clickity sound but not to the point of being annoying. 

I rate both of them 10 out of 10.


======= Battery Life =======

For a gaming laptop, the battery life I experienced has been excellent. When I'm just browsing the web and not gaming, I can get about 4 to 5 hours of battery life at 70 to 80% brightness. During gaming, however, it will last just about 1 hour. 


======= Software =======

The Legion Y530 comes with a minimal amout of bloatware. I counted 3 Lenovo apps, 5 third-party games, and some Microsoft apps such as Xbox and Skype. Compared to other manufacturers' bloatware (e.g., Dell, HP), the Legion Y530 comes packed pretty clean. Windows 10 was at version 1709 and I updated to the latest 1803 Build 17134.191 without a hitch.


======= Upgradeability =======

The Legion Y530 offers several options for future component upgrades - DDR4 memory, SATA3 hard drive (HDD or SSD), Wifi module, and PCI-Express NVME M.2 2280 SSD hard drive. To upgrade, one removes 11 Philips screws from the bottom of the laptop and pop off the bottom cover. The bottom cover is held on by numerous plastic tabs so be gentle when popping the cover off to not break them.


======= My Verdict =======

The Legion Y530 offers a good value, entry-level gaming experience with a great design, slim-bezel display, awesome keyboard and touchpad, great audio, and very decent hardware (6-core Intel Core i7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GPU). It is a well-balanced and harmonius design that is durable, portable, highly performant, and upgradeable. I rate it 4.5 out of 5 and recommend it without hesitation.",optimummind,Well-balanced gaming laptop with great design,3,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",5
"--- Pros ---

- (Performance) This thing is a solid performer the GTX 1050 Ti does not throttle or lose performance and the wireless card is solid. It also has a feature in the software where you hold control+shift+1 and the fans boost to max speed. Overall performance is really solid the i7 8750h is solid processor and the GTX 1050 Ti graphics will allow you to play games like GTA V no problem maybe not on ultra but expect high settings on most games. The 16gb intel optane module available in the 16gb ram configuration definitely speeds up normal usage of the computer if you fill it up mostly with games expect more regular hard drive performance but it does definitely accelerate games, responsiveness, and boot up time
- (Cooling) This laptop has a metal grate on the bottom with two fans on the underside of the boxy part. They are definitely solid and cool the components well. The fans get loud but not too loud everything considered. The laptop does not output all that much heat. I used a Dell G7 for a short period of time and after playing a game it felt like I could heat food up by leaving it next to the back of the laptop NOT SO in this case. It has main intake on the bottom and vents are on the left and right sides of the back and smaller ones on the back of the left and right sides.
- (Keyboard) It's great! No RGB but depending on if you want this laptop for more than gaming it is a pro. Great travel, keys do not feel or look cheap and backlighting does not look cheap. Not a lot of tactile feedback but that is okay because travel is good. The arrow keys are huge however about as big as the left ctrl I do wish that that space could have been used for something else.
- (Speakers) The speakers sound very clear especially for this price range, they are nice and loud and positioned in the front of the laptop not on the keyboard deck or screen area but on the bottom portion facing forward. They lack a LITTLE bit of bass but still are overall very solid.
- (Design) No bezel makes this a compact laptop especially at such and affordable price. Overall it looks really good and cuts the footprint down. The tapered front, the offset screen, with the boxy back is a little different but you definitely get used to it and it is a good design. The hinge definitely looks good at first glance but I noticed the left and right sides start are bent inwards a little bit and are only connected to the main hinge only on one side. That said it stays in place where you leave it, it can bend to 180 degrees if that's important and does not wobble.The texture on the top of the laptop is definitely nice and the legion logo is pretty non obtrusive. Do be warned you cannot turn the light off. The soft touch material on the keyboard deck is also good it feels nice and seems like it will hold up. The laptop has very little flex to it except in the screen which still is not too bad. Power button is in a good position. There is a small minimal white pinhole light on the right side that turns on when the laptop is on and blinks when the computer is sleeping and another very similar one on the back behind the hinge right above the power port that turns orange when the laptop is charging and white when the laptop is fully charged. All of the ports on this laptop are on the back except for two USB 3 ports on the left and right sides and the headphone jack on the left side.
- (Trackpad) The trackpad good very precise just a little on the short and wide side. It would be nice if it was one continuous surface that could be clicked, but the buttons feel solid if not a LITTLE bit loud but still very tactile and very good.
- (Software) The Lenovo software is really good. Hotkeys for max fan and disable keyboard can be configured in Lenovo vantage. The default hotkey for max fan speed is HOLDING ctrl+shift+1. Dolby audio is included and that is good as well as a few other things overall. As with every laptop McAfee free trial -_- and a fairly useless Lenovo app explorer. Overall not a ton of bloatware and a fairly useful utility!

--- Cons ---

- (Display) The display is not very bright or vibrant so be aware of that. 250 nits means it works very so so outdoors and the colors definitely do not pop but it is still very clear and good enough for gaming and the 60hz refresh really does not matter with a 1050 Ti. Also, this is definitely a budget gaming computer so everything considered the display is a alright.
- (Battery) The battery life on this thing is about 4 - 4.5 hours or so when not gaming or doing anything intensive so be aware of that. About 1 - 1.5 hours or less when gaming so keep that in mind. Pretty standard however on a gaming laptop at this price point.
-(repairability) If you do intend to upgrade this laptop down the road be warned it is not an easy thing to do. this laptop has 11 screws and then you have to pry the clips open and it is easy on the front part of the laptop but somewhat nerve racking when you move towards the back so as not the break the clips. I do not know from personal experience but after looking through a couple of forums this is what I learned. I have heard you do not lose your warranty unless you damage the laptop while taking it apart.

- Conclusion -

This laptop is a budget gaming laptop do not expect it to compete with premium laptops such as the razor blade, the Alienware line, or any $1,500 or above gaming laptop. It does a number of this right but the screen is definitely so-so. That is fairly expected as no gaming laptop at this price offers a great screen. Definitely a solid laptop overall if performance is the only thing you care about the G7 is the better choice with a GTX 1060 max q which would give a 50% increase in performance at but definitely at the cost of portability and weight. This is a very compact laptop for the price, cooling, and hardware it offers. If you want a gaming laptop that is compact and a good value look no further. The design of this laptop alone aside from the plastic which is definitely still very good as there is little flex in it. Cooling is great and keyboard and trackpad are solid. Great laptop for a college student who also likes to game aside from the battery life. Overall a would recommend for someone who values portability, design, performance within reason, and price.",AnonymousJK,Great gaming laptop for the price!,2,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",5
"Design:
The Lenovo Legion Y530 is a powerful laptop with a sleek design. This is my first gaming laptop, mostly because I had not found a good hybrid between gaming power and portability until now. I find it to be just thin and light enough to consider it portable, which is great because I am on the go quite often. Although color scheme is not a priority of mine, I like the subtle black exterior with a white illuminated keyboard and logo on the lid. Most of the ports are on the back of the laptop, the impressively effective cooling fans are underneath, and the power button is in the middle above the keyboard. Typing and using the various keys on the keyboard is easy thanks to the sufficient spacing and key size. My only complaint is that the touchpad feels a bit awkward to use due to the location, size, and left/right click buttons instead of a touchpad that clicks down, but that feeling has improved as I have gotten used to it. However, while at home, I prefer to use a mouse. Overall, I think the Lenovo Legion Y530 is a well-designed laptop. 

Features:
The speakers are good, but I have heard better quality sound on several other similar laptops. If you usually use headphones, this may not matter much, but I was expecting better sound quality, especially since it is highlighted as a feature of this Lenovo Legion Y530. The HD webcam is very clear, so I have no complaints there. Since this is a gaming laptop, there is plenty of memory, a powerful processor, and great graphics on a beautiful display. Even standard use, such as browsing the internet or watching videos, is enjoyable due to the speed and quality of the content displayed on the screen. 

Gaming:
With great graphics and lots of processing power, gaming sessions on this laptop are fantastic. I have experienced nothing but smooth gameplay, and I am impressed by the graphics on all the games that I have played. Connecting to Wi-Fi was a breeze, and the connection has always remained stable and fast during online gameplay. As a longtime gamer, I am impressed and would definitely recommend this laptop to fellow gamers. 

Verdict:
The Lenovo Legion Y530 is the perfect blend of power and portability for gaming and everyday use. As opposed to other gaming laptops with flashy designs and colors, I like the subtlety and sleekness of this laptop. Processing power is not compromised due to the compact design, and my gaming sessions have not disappointed. Although it is not perfect in every way, if you are looking for a gaming laptop that is also great for everyday use, then look no further. I recommend the Lenovo Legion Y530 to others with confidence.",Kelby,"Finally, Power and Portability in a Gaming Laptop",1,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",5
"I bought the Legion Y530 with the i7-8750H, 16GB, 128GB + 1TB HDD, 1050TI. I tested out a lot of different gaming laptops before settling on this one due to the price, aesthetics, warranty, and ability to run all the modern games I play at 60fps. The laptop doesn't have some features more expensive gaming laptops have such as multi-colored keyboard lighting, 120hz display, Thunderbolt 3. But it more than makes up for it with its sleek, slim design, beautiful display, thin bezels only more expensive laptops have, and a 1050TI that is still more than capable in 1080p gaming. I really loved how solid this laptop felt in my hands too, it really feels like it could take a fall with many scruffs and still run. The MSI GS65 I tried was a bit too fragile in the hands in my opinion. I purchased an extended on-site warranty and accidental damage plan for peace of mind too. The keyboard also feels very solid, it has a nice depth to it and is satisfying to press down on.

I enjoyed the 2 USB ports on the side of the laptop for a wireless receiver and USB drive. Most other ports are in the back for nice cable management. My gaming desk looks good when I'm not portable - no hanging wires on the side, rather out of sight in the back.

The battery will last you about 3-4 hours off the charge realistically. This is enough for my needs but is something to consider if you are frequently without an outlet nearby. You will always want to game with the laptop plugged in for maximum performance, I do not enjoy gaming without the battery plugged in for any gaming laptops.

After very light tweaking, I haven't run into any heat issues so far. The i7-8750H do run hot in these slim laptops in general, so be sure to read forums and do your own proper research to understand more about it. I get under 89C for the CPU during gaming, GPU always under 70C. Very acceptable to me. With Lenovo Vantage software you can press Control + Shift + 1 to turn on the Cooler Boost to help with cooling too. I would like to see Lenovo come out with more detailed fan control and the ability to control the Turbo Cooler Boost to your liking.

I am able to run most of my games at or around 60fps on high and medium settings, never low. The games I play are Sea of Thieves, Battlefield 4/1, Call of Duty BO4, PUBG, Overwatch, WoW, Skyrim, CSGO, Rainbow 6 Siege and other indie and older games that run it with ease.",PlainSight,"Great entry level, budget gaming laptop",1,0,"Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black",5
"Pros
. Intel Optane with 32GB
. Nice backlit full key keyboard
. Great dual cooling system
. 6-core i7 8th generation
. Gtx 1050ti graphics card
. Great touchpad
. 1TB drive 
Cons
. Camera is on the bottom of the screen
. HDD instead of SDD 

With a 16GB RAM, instead of the 8GB model, there is a lot to like about this Lenovo Legion Y530. The design is excellent: relatively light and thin for a gaming laptop, a great touch pad and a nice back-lit full key keyboard although you can’t change the color of the light.

Because it uses an Intel i7 CPU and a GTX 1050ti GPU it does get hot but it has a great dual cooling system that can be adjusted via software. For everyday tasks, the battery lasts a little over 4 hours but I do not recommend to run games on batteries. In my experience, I had to connect it to power in about an hour after playing Battlefield but that is expected with a powerful laptop like this one. It does video editing well too but the battery charge won’t last for very long either. Again, this is expected and is the price you pay for such power. 

I noted a considerable difference in performance between this and the 8MB model in both gaming and video editing. And apparently, I had a few more minutes of battery time as well. My guess is that it is due to the extra RAM and the Intel Octane.

Good IPS display. The plastic body doesn’t feel cheap. The speakers are above average. 802.11ac WiFi performs very well and it also comes with Ethernet, USB 3 and type C ports as well as HDMI and mini DP.

It uses a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) instead of a Solid State Drive (SSD) but the built-in Intel Octane 32GB makes its performance somewhat similar to an SSD. Although my preference is for 32GB, 16 GB of RAM is a fairly good amount for most applications. Lastly, the camera is on the bottom, not the top of the screen. Not an issue for many people and not a deal breaker for me but it is not my preferred place for a camera. 

Overall, it is a great gaming laptop for gaming and for not-too-complex video editing. Unless you are a hard core gamer willing to spend at least twice as much, you can’t go wrong with this laptop.

"There are just so many things this laptop does right:

-NO RED. For whatever reason most companies who make gaming laptops think everyone wants red all over the keyboard and laptop. This is a clean white touch.
-Amazing screen. Picture quality is incredibly sharp.
-Price point. Right around $1000 for these specifications is ideal.
-Plug in's are on the back of the laptop. It's frustrating when power, Ethernet, USB, etc plug ins are on the side. This one moves it to the back.

Areas I wish were better:

-There's a separate left and right click button on the track pad. Wish I could just click the track pad, but you get used to it.
-Weight. It's slightly heavy here at about 4 lbs. Not the worst but it's noticeable.
-Number pad is in a slightly odd place. I dont use this too much but if you do it's something to keep in mind.

"In a word... WOW!

Okay, so now to the review after getting that out of the way. First a little back story and I will attempt to keep this short for those of you that get bored easily. :) I have been searching, debating, thinking, reviewing for about 2 months prior to making a purchase. The MSI GS65 kept yelling at me, ""Pick me, Pick me!"" However, when I went in to buy it, I was talked into buying the Microsoft Surface Book 2 (SB2 moving forward) as I was told it would be better for both productivity and gaming. Not necessarily better at gaming, but a more well-rounded laptop due to my needs. I will say that the SB2 is a beautiful machine with an amazing screen, but in no way does it come close to the gaming performance of this BEAST! More on that soon.

I am the type that really needs / requires a bright and vibrant screen. The whites to be white and not washed out, the blacks to be black, etc. That was my one hesitation I had when looking at this in the store, that it didn't come across as overly bright and vibrant. Well, then I get it home and my worst fears were NOT realized. The colors are beautiful, the whites are white and there are a multitude of options to change the colors, brightness, etc. MSI True Color works very well. Does it compare to the SB2 as far as clarity, vibrancy and color representation? No, but it certainly holds it own for a 1080P screen. The 144HZ more than makes up for it to say the least. I can no longer go back to a 60HZ screen after this. Thanks, MSI for ruining me in that way!

Performance: Again in comparing SB2's performance to the GS65, I tried several games. GTA V I was getting 35 - 55 FPS on normal (medium) settings and on the SB2, I am getting between 90-130 FPS on mostly high settings on the GS65. COD Black Ops 3 via Steam on the SB2 - 40 - 50 FPS, GS65 144HZ consistently. Forza 7 via Windows 10 gaming, 60FPS on the SB2 and 144HZ on the GS65. Ridiculous!

One other thing I don't like about the SB2 is the 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand some people like it, but I don't.

Fan noise: I honestly don't think it is loud at all. Can I hear it? Sure, but in no way is it distracting. Either I have poor hearing (which I don't) or I just don't care as much as some people. It truly isn't loud nor distracting, but you can hear it at times. 

The 3 cons I have are these:

1. The trackpad isn't very good. I use a gaming mouse, so it isn't a huge deal for me, but it's not good.

2. The speakers sound so-so, but the volume doesn't get loud at all. Not sure why that is, but in some programs I have to turn the volume up to 80 and that's a little odd. Perhaps a driver issue, I don't know.

3. Lastly and my biggest complaint of all is the difficulty in upgrading the SSD and RAM. With the flipped motherboard, it makes it quite risky and certainly a pain in the patootie to do so. Yes, I said patootie. I think I will take it to a computer repair shop to do so because if they mess it up, its on them.

One side note. The 512GB SSD runs out of room quickly, so I have attached a 4TB external portable hard drive to it and have loaded my Windows 10 games, PC games and Steam games to it. I have seen no drop in FPS or performance at all. Sure, the loading times are a little slower, but game-play is seamless. 

In conclusion, if you are on the fence about getting the MSI GS65, jump off the fence, run quickly to Best Buy and get it. I have absolutely no buyers remorse after returning the SB2 and picking this up. None. It is classy looking so I can use it at work and powerful enough to run all current games without issue.

"Disclosure: I am typing this review for that MSI Siberia 200 Headset promotion (If it's free, it's for me) and also for anyone like me. This review is made for a normal buyer, no intensive specs of test results were included. (Short or Long Review Ahead)

I was always hesitant to purchase any laptop for school as they always had a downside. Whether it was the ridiculous battery, the low specs, the coil whine, or the lack of ports; something always strayed me away from purchasing one. I looked online for about 4 months after finding it necessary to purchase one and I began narrowing down my suggestions from gaming laptops, 2-in-1's, Macbooks, and some high-end non-gaming laptops. They were priced anywhere from $1000-$4000, I just wanted one to meet my expectations. One day, after reviewing my options , I happened to stumble across the MSI GS65 on my suggested recommendations. I checked it out and was baffled by it's specs. Considering it is not as heavy as the other gaming laptops, I am amazed they put that kind of power into this machine. After looking at reviews online, I decided to add it to my possible purchase list and found two other suggestions: the Aero 15x and the Razor Blade 15"". 

After some more research, it came down to the following:
Aero 15x (Laptop/$2000+)
Apple Macbook Pro 15"" (Laptop/$2000+)
Dell XPS 15"" (Laptop/$1000+)
HP Spectre x360 (2-in-1/$800+)
HP Omen 15"" (Laptop/$800+)
Lenovo Yoga 920 (2-in-1/$1000+)
Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (2-in-1/$700+)
MSI GS65 (Laptop/$1800+)
Razer Blade 15"" (Laptop/$1900+)

Now, I don't want to highlight every single problem I had with my other options as this is a review for the MSI GS65. But, to summarize, it came down to these factors:
- I don't really need a touch screen. Sure it is nice but, it gives the machine less performance and I had no real need for it as I don't draw.
- Customer service must not be impossible to reach. If something is wrong, I don't want to have my money go down the drain for a defect in the product.
- It should be able to run games like the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. I don't want 60 FPS on Ultra, I just want to be able to play when I have some spare time and for my laptop to handle it.
- I want Windows as my OS, I love Apple's OS but, I am more familiar with WIndows.
- I am a procrastinator and I need something that I can carry to do work as I am commuting. I also need less weight so I don't feel it when I have to run when I catch the bus.
- I will avoid screen bleed as much as possible, I want that rich color when I edit pictures or play games.
- Fan noise must be tolerable, the quieter the better. It's a plus if the pitch is lower too, can't stand a high whirling fan.

After doing a spreadsheet comparing specs of the models and the models of those models. I came down to the MSI GS65-037 or MSI GS65-068. Given I was hoping to get it as soon as possible I found the 037 model was in stock at my local Bestbuy, I made some compromises and picked it up that same day. Now, for the actual review and I'll try to keep it short.

- Case/Weight
Pro: It is ridiculously light, seriously, it's not bulky as other gaming laptops I have researched or tried out myself. It also looks sleek and eye catching before even opening it. The gold edges make it feel as you are living in luxury.
Con: It does seem a bit flimsy, I don't really mind it but, some people may prefer a sturdier build.
- Display Screen
Pro: Rich, vivid colors whether gaming, browsing or simply admiring the desktop screen. That 144HZ screen is phenomenal.
Con: No G-Sync, may be a problem for other users but, the lack of it gives it better battery if that helps.
Tip: Change the display setting if you plan on editing pictures or videos for more accurate colors.
- Keyboard and Track Pad
Pro: Beautiful low-end, lights are responsive and I haven't had any issues with it so far. I personally love the spacing.
Con: The track pad is awful compared to the competition. I couldn't even use it to finish setting up my computer and I had to connect my Bluetooth mouse. Then again, I don't really use track pads and I have a mouse. The keyboard may not feel perfect for some users, I suggest trying our the track pad and keys before purchase.
- Battery
Pro: I get about 1 hour and a half gaming on the go and 4-5 hours while browsing, doing homework and listening to music. I am happy with these numbers. I would love it if it could be longer but, I'll wait until a newer model can surpass these numbers.
Con: No real problem but same with every other laptop, get rid of those useless tasks running in background or your laptop may die before the estimated 8 hours lifetime.
- Internals
Pro: The GTX 1070 Max-Q and that 8th gen i7 work wonders. You can expect 50-60 frames in Ultra on Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and better on some less intensive games. Keep it plugged in though as with any other laptop or you may not get the smoothest performance. With that power, expect no problems browsing on the web or running programs like Revit or AutoCAD.
Con: If you plan on upgrading the ram or SSD, expect having a hard time doing so. You have to remove the motherboard in order to do so and it may void your warranty. I suggest taking it to an expert and doing so for you. I myself am able to do it but, I am not taking chances.
- Speakers
Pro: Amazing for laptop speakers, nice volume range and above average sound quality. I personally listen to alternative rock and did some tests with other genres if that helps.
Con: It does get a bit fuzzy as you raise the volume but, then again, why would you blast music on your laptop?
- Operating Software
Pro: If you prefer Windows over Linux or Mac OS.
Con: Windows 10.
- Fans
Pro: Quiet for the most part, it will pick up if you begin running intensive programs. It's bearable, I suggest looking online for some tests if you want to hear it for yourself.
Con: Don't play games or running intensive programs on your lap, it does get hot. Keep in mind that this machine is thin, since it's not as bulky as it's competition, it will get hot and it may burn a little. Let it cool after playing to avoid feeling that heat or don't. Some of you may like that feeling I guess.
Tip: I suggest re-pasting with liquid metal for best temperatures but, don't try it yourself if you don't know how to or not that great at it. Again, it may void warranty.

In conclusion, this machine is just wow. It doesn't get much better than this for now. If you can't afford this computer at this moment, consider saving up or waiting till the price drops a couple hundred.

"Full Disclosure: I am writing this review to receive a free headset. That being said, this review embodies my true thoughts about this laptop.

Backstory:
I’m an incoming college freshman who needed a new laptop for college work. I like to play games and previously played on a PS4. I needed a laptop and couldn’t take my PS4 with me so I decided I wanted to get something that would let me jump into the PC gaming world. I researched for several months looking for the best laptop that would let me play top games at ultra settings. I also wanted something that would be thin and light enough that I could take it to class with me. I had pretty much narrowed my search down to the Razer Blade 15, the Asus Zephyrus GM501, the Gigabyte Aero 15x and of course the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. I ultimately decided on the Stealth Thin for its more subdued, professional look, price point, and manufacturer’s support(read: support from the manufacturer if something breaks in the laptop)

My First Experience:
The first time I took home the Stealth Thin I was pumped to download some games that could test it, like GTA V and Far Cry 5 for example. I was immediately notified by the other members using the wifi that I had completely cut them off from receiving bandwidth. I had somewhat shrugged it off, assuming that everything would be fine after the large download was done. Once it was done, I hopped on to GTA with a buddy and tried talking with him on Discord using my wired headset I already owned. I plugged it in using the appropriate splitter necessary to use both input and output. He was unable to hear me, sure enough after going into the Discord settings, then ultimately the sound settings in Windows, I was getting no feedback from my mic, but I was still able to hear all audio just fine. I later went through all the troubleshooting I could think of, updating and reinstalling drivers for anything sound and microphone related, boosting the microphone levels, plugging in and trying different headsets, the whole nine yards. It was a very frustrating week or so... I decided to just play anyways to test the very expensive piece of hardware I just bought. The game ran great at ultra settings outputting well over 60fps. Same went for Far Cry 5 which ran similarly well. However, this is where I ran into more internet related problems. Using Ookla I was able to test at a couple mbps down and about one mbps up, all while causing everyone else using the wifi to be booted off the network as well. I knew I wasn’t using all the bandwidth as I was only getting a couple mbps and I pay for and regularly get over 100 mbps. Granted, this issue could have been a result of my router incorrectly sending all the bandwidth to my laptop as it thought I needed more because I was still getting slow speeds on my laptop. However, my router had never experienced any previous problems, even with 5 iPhones, 3 iPads, 2 PS4s and 2 computers all connected and simultaneously using the internet. Back to the laptop itself, I also experienced a loose and creaky panel right in front of the trackpad(between the user and the trackpad). Anytime my finger or anything would touch it, it would give a little and make a popping/clicking noise. This was a little disappointing as I just paid $2000 for a laptop that I hadn’t even had for a week and it already was showing signs of wear after sitting on a desk for approximately a week, not having even been moved.

Lucky Return:
While I was trying to look around to see if anyone else had issues with not being able to use a mic in the Best Buy reviews, I noticed that it was now on sale for $150 less than what I had bought it for. I lucked out and realized that that it was the last day I could take the laptop in and get a price adjustment. I decided that I would further push my luck and take it into the Geek Squad to see if they could fix my microphone jack issues or even better: give me a new replacement. The gentleman at Geek Squad was very nice and understanding about my concerns with the laptop. He tried to fix it for a while and then did ultimately come up with some kind of halfway fix but it wasn’t perfect. He offered me the choice of getting a new laptop and starting over or just keeping my same one. I gladly accepted the new laptop and he was even able to give me the price adjustment. I felt super lucky to have been able to not only get another laptop but also receive the $150 off of the laptop as well just before the return period was up. The Geek Squad/Best Buy service was great when I came in with this issue.

My Second(and much better) Experience:
This time when I took the laptop home, it was wayyyy better. It still sucked up quite a bit of bandwidth while downloading the large games, but once it was done and doing normal, less intensive tasks, I had no issues. The microphone jack actually worked right out of the box! And so far(fingers crossed) I have not encountered any clicking of the panel below the trackpad, even as I have carried it with me to class several times now. I must have just received a bad laptop the first time as this one that I currently have now works as it should.

The Laptop:
Now finally onto my actual thoughts on the laptop itself. I really like this laptop, it runs games really well and switches between dedicated and integrated graphics flawlessly when playing games and doing general productivity tasks as it should. The temps are generally pretty fair, peaking at high 80s to low 90s under full loads(my first laptop did encounter a bit of throttling capped at about 95 under load, this has not occurred yet with my second laptop). The fans can get a little noisy under load but do not whine or shriek. They are just about inaudible while just doing normal tasks. They are also easily blocked out by even a decent pair of headphones though. The screen of this laptop is actually pretty nice, I’m not super picky about screens, but I found the high refresh rate to be great and it seems to accurately display colors as well. I absolutely love the thin bezels this screen has and the bezels were actually one of the reasons I chose this laptop over some of the others. I also really like the keyboard. The keys feel springy and make a satisfying noise. The lighting options and customizability with the SteelSeries Engine 3 app are very fun too. I sort of wish that there was a number pad, but then the whole layout and spacing of the keys would be different and I like being able to type on a pretty regularly sized keyboard, so it is a tradeoff you have to make with this size of laptop. The trackpad is not my favorite… It seems to track my movements fairly well and the size and look of the trackpad is nice as well. But where it really suffers a bit is clicking. You have to click the actual trackpad itself as there aren’t any dedicated mouse buttons, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the amount of force it takes to click if you aren’t pushing near the very bottom is pretty high. This also makes it really hard to drag and drop anything too. This isn’t a huge deal to me though as I usually use a mouse anyways but I thought it did deserve a mention. Onto the ports, I feel like the Stealth Thin has a great selection of ports with 3 USB type A, a thunderbolt 3 enabled USB C, a mini displayport, an HDMI port, an audio in jack and an audio out jack, the power port and even a gigabit ethernet port. I feel like they maybe should have included a SD card reader as this laptop looks somewhat professional and many professionals like to transfer files on SD cards but it doesn’t really bother me as I use flash drives more. Now for a little bit about the inside. You can easily find what this laptop is made of but I do want to clarify a few quirky things. This special Best Buy edition has a 512 GB SATA ssd. This is still super fast to me as I previously have only used hdd but I feel it should be mentioned as this laptop does have two(one empty) M.2 slots. The 512 GB ssd is partitioned into one drive with about 280 GB and another drive with about 175 GB. I’m sure you can take out the partition with 3rd party software but I could not unpartition it myself using just the windows software. This actually turned out to not be a huge deal as I just linked my Steam library to span across both “drives”. Lastly, I’ll talk about the exterior of the laptop. While I love the sharp look of the black and gold/copper accents, the black metal casing really picks up oil from fingerprints. It’s easily cleaned and wiped down but it does acquire fingerprints pretty quickly. As for the build quality, I’m satisfied with my second laptop. It’s not flimsy, but it’s not a Macbook. It’s very thin and light for a legitimate gaming laptop so obviously you have to make a few sacrifices. 

Overall:
I am very happy with my SECOND laptop. I’m not sure if I would have been able to say the same with the first one I had but I’m very glad that Best Buy let me exchange mine. The sub-par quality of the first laptop is the only reason I took off a star, if I had gotten my second laptop the first time around it would be an easy 5 stars. It’s a very powerful and sleek looking machine that destroys pretty much any task you throw at it. I would definitely recommend this laptop to any gamer out there.",ChicoStateStudent,Great Laptop the Second Time Around,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",4
"Like the title states, the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin is quite easily one of the best laptops on the market right now for not only gaming, but also productivity related tasks.

Build Quality & Design:
The chassis appears to be a very thin aluminum. This allows the laptop to be incredibly lightweight, which is one of the best aspects of this laptop. For a 15.6"" laptop, it feels relatively as heavy as an iPad pro with a type cover attached - that is to say, not very heavy. The trade off to this is that the laptop does have some flex in certain areas. The display does flex slightly when opening and there is some slight flex over the vent above the keyboard. However in everyday use it's not noticeable (how often do you really just press down on random areas of the chassis of your laptop..?). There is little-to-no flex in the keyboard or palm rests. 
The design is superb. The design is very nice and subdued. It's something you can take out in a coffee shop, school, or at most individual's office space and not feel as though all eyes are judging. The gold dragon is the only thing that clues this as being a little different than your run-of-the-mill laptop, and it looks more elegant than gaudy. The keyboard however does have an eclectic font typeface. However, this is a completely subjective aspect of the laptop, neither good nor bad. I personally find the font to be fun and I enjoy it. The keyboard comes with RGB lighting which can be customized or disabled as you prefer. The quality of the lighting is superb, and seems on par with Razer's ""Chroma"". 
As far as the display, it's beautiful. The brightness is somewhere between standard and great. It's not the brightest screen, but it definitely does well for daily use. As far as screen bleeding, this is easily the first laptop screen I've owned that has absolutely NO screen bleed (seriously!), which is a massive 5 star to MSI. I don't know if I hit the display lottery, but I'm very happy with this display. The 144hz refresh rate also allows for snappy performance and looks great - particularly when scrolling through extensive word and excel documents. Text doesn't blur together, it remains crisp. 

Performance:
Unfortunately, I can't speak much to the power of the i7-8750H as I don't do any photo or video editing. However, I can comment about the GPU. The GTX 1070 is of the max-q variant, meaning it is approximately 10-15% slower than the standard mobile 1070. This is a good thing as it allows the computer to run cooler and have better battery life without significant drop in performance. This laptop will shred through most modern AAA titles at 70+ FPS at 1080p resolution (I can't speak on 4K gaming). The thermals are also good, for a laptop this size. You have to compromise a little when it comes to thermals. Small packages cannot deliver low temperatures. However, MSI has done a good job. With three exhaust vents (two on the sides, one in the back), there is plenty is space to dispel the heat. There are also two large air intake vents on the top and bottom of the keyboard. As a result, the laptop stays relatively cool while gaming both internally and to the touch over the keyboard and palm rests. The fans do kick on during serious gaming, but the sound is a lower, less distracting, whirling sound. You'll notice it, but likely be okay with it. 

Battery:
This is one of the big selling points to me. For such a powerful laptop, the battery during normal operation is phenomenal. Combinations of web browsing, YouTube, listening to music, and working in Microsoft office programs, I average between 6-10 hours (depending on what all I have open). Gaming is substantially less - around 1 hour to 4 hours (depending on the game). You'll want your charger if you plan on gaming for hours on end. 

Other:
Audio is good. Laptop speakers are almost always awful. These are pretty good for simple YouTube and movie watching. If you're seriously into gaming or are an audiophile, you'll likely be using headphones anyways which makes it a non-issue. If you don't have headphones, go get a pair. The built in audio drivers are pretty good with headphones. The touchpad uses windows precision drivers and is very responsive. It's a little smaller than something like the macbook pro or surface book, but I never found that I ran out of space during normal use. It's positioned more on the left side of the laptop which is nice for typing (as your palm doesn't brush up against it), but can be uncomfortable to use for an extended period of time as your right hand has to bend sideways more. Yet again, it's not a deal breaker at the least, just something I've noticed. If you plan on doing a lot of mouse intense work, you'd likely want a mouse anyways, regardless of the laptop. There are no biometric login features, so no Windows Hello or fingerprint. However, I find that a quick 4 digit pin number unlocks just as quick as it takes for most Windows Hello equipped laptop's infrared cameras to kick on.

Bottom line:
No laptop is perfect. But this one is dang near close and I have to give a lot of credit to MSI for delivering such a great product. If you're a student, a hardcore gamer, or just your standard guy/gal who needs a solid laptop who also likes to play some games - this is the laptop for you. I hope this helps some of you in your decision.

Note: 
The 512gb hard drive that comes with this Best Buy edition is partitioned into two drives: (Windows C:\ and Data D:\). There is nothing on the Data partition and can be deleted and reallocated to the C:\ drive for a larger volume. You will need a third party partition manager (I used MiniTool Partition Free) to delete the D:\ drive and extend the size of the C:\ drive. Before doing this, make sure you grab a flash drive and create a recovery drive just in case something goes south and you need to reinstall windows from scratch. You can also delete the hibernation file (Open command prompt in admin mode, type powercfg /hibernation off) to save an extra 6gb of storage.",nova,Best Laptop Available - Gaming & Productivity,7,1,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I've only had the MSi GS65 Stealth Thin for about a week, but so far, I'm very pleased with it. I bought the MSI GS65 mainly for 3D content creation on the go with ability to do some light gaming. My main work and play computer is custom built desktop, and My last laptop was a 2012 Alienware m17x r4. I really wanted a lighter, smaller form factor laptop to travel with, and was also considering the Razer 15, Acer Aero 15x, ASUS Zephyrus, and possibly another Alienware. I chose the MSi because of its more mature stylings, small form factor, performance, upgradability (having 2 M.2 slots), and price coming in at under $2k.

Styling and Build Quality:
The GS65 looks great with it's thin bezels and black matte finish with rose gold details. A very refreshing and mature look for a gaming laptop. The weight of the GS65 is a very easy at 4.5 lbs and the laptop in general is very sleek and easy to transport. It's no where near ultra book sleek but it's huge improvement one past gaming laptops that could weight 10 lbs or more. The GS65 has some flex in the chassis and lid, but that's to be expected as it's not a milled aluminum uni-body, like the Razers or Macbooks, and the bezels around the screen are very thin. Mine also doesn't have very much creak or rattle that others have mentioned. It is somewhat of a finger print magnet. If you going to add an SSD, more RAM, or re-paste, then be prepared for a stressful chore, as the motherboard needs to be completely removed to accomplish these things. I haven’t torn down the GS65 myself, but will be soon and I am not looking forward to it. Overall it has a nice design aesthetic and an acceptable fit and finish, with a questionable motherboard layout. The GS65 feels nice to handle and to look at. Just don't expect the GS65 to be as solidly built as a Macbook, Razer, or Surface Book.
 
Performance: 
The GS65 is a beast with it's 6 core i7 8750H. I haven't performed any tests or benchmarks, but it breezes through the applications I use daily. 3dsmax, photoshop, Substance Designer, Zbrush, and the UE4 editor all work great. I haven't done any rendering or lighting builds yet, so I can't speak for that yet. As far as gaming goes, I've only downloaded a few games all of which ran great. Doom, Quake Champions, and Fortnite all average 120 fps or higher on high or ultra settings. I feel the 1070 max-q graphics card will be adequate for gaming for the next few years at least. The M.2 512gb SSD on the GS65 is a SanDisk and SATA not a NVMe PCIe. I would have preferred a PCIe drive but it works fine and boots quickly. The drive is split in to 2 partitions, making a smallish drive even smaller, which I really didn’t care for. It was an easy fix though. I re-partitioned it using a free hard drive management software that I downloaded (I end up using minitool). 

Heat and Fan Noise:
With out of the box settings the laptop gets hot quick under heavy load or gaming. Using HWMonitor I saw CPU temps of up to 94C while gaming and running programs for content creation. But that was easily and quickly helped by tuning the fan profiles. That alone seemed to drop the temps down 5-7 degrees C. Under normal use the temps never leave the 50s. I haven't re-pasted or under-volted the cpu, but it’s something I plan to do soon. The fans aren't very aggressive and even in max ""cooler boost"" setting aren't crazy loud, and they don't have any whine or harshness to their tone. I can definitely tell the fans there when they start to kick up rpm, but that doesn't really happen unless I'm gaming, and I wear a headset while gaming. The fan noise isn't enough to carry over my mic using Discord.

Screen and Speakers:
I would have preferred a 4K screen for productivity, but this screen is very good, and probably better for a pure gaming experience. At 144Hz this screen is buttery smooth while gaming. I never had any tearing or stuttering. The colors are decent for a monitor targeted for fast FPS gaming. It has 6 pre-set color modes and is fairly easy to adjust. The contrast and viewing angles are good, but not at true IPS level. The brightness is great for most indoor lighting, but it's not really bright enough if you’re by a sunny window or sitting outside during the day. I could see everything okay while in the sun, but it wasn't very comfortable on my eyes. It gets fairly dim on the lowest setting and coupled with the anti-blue mode it is very easy on the eyes in a dark room. I use a high contrast windows theme with a mainly black desktop and black or dark gray themes in all apps that allow me to change color settings, and I have notice hardly any backlight bleed. The speakers are surprisingly loud and clear for being downward firing in a slim laptop, and only slightly muddy. They’re slightly tinny and could use more bass fullness. Not the best laptop speakers I ever heard, but I’ve heard worse on much larger laptops. The speakers are decent if just listening to a podcast or instructional YouTube video, but if you want to game, listen to music or watch a movie you’ll want to put on some headphones.

Battery Life:
The battery life of the GS65 is expectedly short while gaming or using demanding software. Under normal daily mixed use of surfing the web with multiple browser tabs open, sporadic watching of YouTube, music streaming, and email checking, I’m averaging about 4hrs. While that’s not a great battery life, I also haven’t done any battery calibration, or changed any power settings yet. That’s about 4hrs out of the GS65 with out of the box settings for the most part. With Wi-Fi on, the monitor and RGB lighting on full brightness, and CPU on comfort mode. I’m sure with the RGB off slightly dimmer monitor and a little power setting adjustments I think the GS65 could be stretched out to its 8 hour claim.

Keyboard and Track Pad:
I’m used to a full-sized mechanical keyboard, and my old laptop is a 17.3” so the GS65s Keyboard is a little small for me. It also lacks a 10 key. It has vey nice pressure and decent key travel. It is nice to type on once I got used to the key spacing. It has 2nd forward slash keys for some reason, but that doesn’t really bother me, and all the shortcut keys make sense to me. If you’re into RGB lighting, the GS65s keyboard is easily customizable using the SteelSeries Engine 3 software. You can program color, brightness and lighting patterns on the entire keyboard, and change the key binding on all keys. The GS65s trackpad is smooth and allows my fingers to glide across smoothly. The trackpad feels accurate and responds well to zooming and scrolling gestures (those are the only ones I use). But, the clicking on the GS65 leaves much to be desired. The GS65 doesn’t have separate mouse buttons, you must click the track pad itself. The click is hard to actuate the higher up on the trackpad you press, and is best accomplished by pressing all the way in the lower left corner, as I have found myself accidentally right clicking multiple times. The trackpad issues on the GS65 aren’t much of an issue for me though, as most of the time I’m using a wireless mouse, but if you don’t use a mouse the track pad could become annoying.

Software:
The GS65 comes with the some of bloatware, but bit didn’t have as much as is usual with ASUS or Alienware, and it was all easily removed. It comes with SteelSeries Engine 3 to control the keyboard lighting and binding, and I have to say I like it a lot. It’s very easy configure the keyboard to your liking on the GS65. It also comes with MSi Dragon Center, which is the app used as the central hub for simple tuning and the basic maintenance of the laptop, as well as backup creation and the user manual. MSi Dragon Center is straight forward and easy to use, but it is also limited. If you want more control of the tune-ability of the GS65 then you might want to download separate software for that. It doesn’t yet support any type of face recognition or biometric security.

Conclusion
I would highly recommend the MSi GS65 Stealth Thin to anyone that wants a thin and light gaming setup, with enough processing power to work on photo/video editing and 3D content creation. It has a few quirks like the tricky trackpad clicking, flipped motherboard, and weird SSD partitioning. The fit and finish level isn’t as good as others. But overall, it’s looks are sleek and refreshingly un-gamer, it stays relatively cool and quit, and packs massive performance in a small, thin, and light weight package.",Ponyheart,Very impressed so far.,2,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5

Back Story:
I work remotely on the internet, and occasionally travel, and needed to upgrade from my Lenovo Y50. I was ready for a more professional looking laptop. My first though was the Razer Blade 15. After considering the price, I really didn't want to shell out $3,000+ for a laptop that wasn't made by Apple. My main desktop PC has a 144hz display, so I really liked that ($600 upgrade from 60hz on Blade 15""). For a while, I considered picking up a Surface Laptop for $1,000 and calling it a day, certainly it'd handle what I needed it for. After about a month of research, I went down to my local Best Buy and pulled the trigger. 

First Impressions:
-Great Packaging by MSI
-Really Sleek from Most Angles
-Nice Keyboard Feel
-Frustrating Track-pad (always use mouse so IDC)
-Really Nice Display
-Great Form Factor (Seeing this Next to the Alien 15"" in the store was nuts) 
-Slight Quality-Control Concerns - The little strip right below the track-pad sort of clicked when I first started using it. Not a deal breaker for me, it's not broken, perhaps just a result of not being uni-body. 
-Nice Uniformly Bright and Vibrant Display
-Fans Got a Bit Noisy but Easy Remedies in the MSI app

Gaming: Strictly for research purposes, the first thing I did was install Steam and PUBG and fired it up and played a couple games. The laptop did not get to hot to use. The fans were a bit loud but I had headphones on and only noticed when I took them off. It kept the laptop cool the whole time and I didn't notice any decline of performance. (I ran PUBG for about 45 min on Medium everything locked at a solid 120ish FPS). 

General Use + Battery: 
-Watched 3 hours of YouTube, Installed Spotify, Discord and had the RGB keyboard on all the time
-Always used headphones for volume (Sorry, I don't use my laptop for a quality speaker experience)
-Browsed the internet for maybe 1 hour
-Battery is now at 17%

Overall
Sorry this review is everywhere, sort of just stream of conscience

Value (Not Necessarily Price) and Side Note
The Best Buy version of this laptop ditches the Killer Brand Wi-Fi and M.2 SDD for an Intel Wi-Fi Antenna and Sata SDD. That's what get this much laptop (slightly) under $2,000. Perhaps people want to know that, so it's worth mentioning. For me, this helps increase the value of this laptop. This laptop has 16GB of DDR, a 6-core i7, and a GTX 1070 MQ, all while having a sleek design, thin bezels and 144hz display. Additionally, it has pretty much every port you want, minus maybe the SD card slot. Is this as premium as a MacBook Pro or a Razer Blade 15? No, it's not. Does it come really close? Yeah. If having a uni-body laptop is your thing, you have the Razer. In my research, a similarly specced Blade 15 cost $1,000 more. The value is clearly here, but you may have a different budget. 

Cons:
-Clicking panel below the trackpad
-(for all the internet reviewers) squishy above the keyboard, though no keyboard flex. Hasn't affected usability, for me, at all. 
-fingerprint/palm mark magnet - pretty much leaves a spot anywhere you touch
-track-pad isn't very good (I was trying to use a slider to adjust a friend's volume in discord and it took me 20+ tries) Perhaps just software but it was frustrating.
-font on keys (preference) They've ditched the red everywhere look but still have a font on the keys that looks borrowed from the Spider Man movies. 

Pros:
-Screen - Fast and Bright
-Overall Design - Small form-factor, light (compared to a traditional gaming laptop, thin bezels, nice grainy finish. Easily blends in. I'll be bringing this with me to meet with clients and while I may not have the full-RGB rainbow keyboard on display, it looks classy, even premium (minus the Spider Man font)
-keyboard feel: I had a MacBook Pro 15"" from 2008-2013 and this keyboard feels as good as that. My desktop keyboard has cherry mx red switches and while this is obviously no where near that satisfying, there is a clear actuation and the keys don't tend to wiggle around. It took no time for me to get used to this keyboard (typing this review on it)
-quick and responsive - while I fully expect a laptop with this spec to be quick, overall it's a very satisfying experience. I tested some surface product out when I was in the research phase and some of the $1,200 Surface Laptop models didn't feel especially snappy or responsive. I haven't had a single incident of slowdown or throttling. I do a lot of 3D rendering with Octane Render, so I'll update my review once I test that.
-portable - I've often dreaded bring my other laptops on trips. I'm excited to bring this with me and still not be sacrificing on power. I say this laptop side by side with the blade 15 and the form factor is pretty much identical (the blade has a smaller chin below the screen. 

That's all my ramblings on this little beast. It's cool to see MSI start implementing more premium designs on their gaming laptops (now please ditch the keyboard font). I can't wait to go to a coffee shop, pop this open in the sea of Macs and know that I could easily run any game on max (even if I'm just browsing reddit :)

If you're looking for a sick laptop, I don't see many other's that are nearly this good of a value.",Nate,Really Great Laptop For At This Pricepoint,3,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",4
"Full Disclosure: I was incentivised to write this review thanks to the MSI offer of a Steelseries Headset upon submission of a review. There was no requirement for a minimum score.

 I was looking for a gaming laptop a bit different from the monsters that used to define this sort of thing - something lightweight, that wouldn't look out of place in an office whilst still being able to pump out games for years to come. My previous laptop recently died after 7 years of hard labour, and I wanted to treat myself to something that would last. I considered several of the new Intel 8th generation lightweight gaming laptops before choosing this one.

This model from BestBuy came with 16 GB 2400 MHz dual channel RAM, a 512 GB Toshiba M.2 SSD (not as fast as the NVMe in other models, but the most storage at this price point and a second unused SSD slot), the Killer N1550 wireless card (which has been fine so far) and the Max-Q GTX 1070 GPU. 

I had this shipped from BestBuy (via UPS), and it arrived triple-boxed. The innermost, MSI-branded box contained the laptop (in two protective sleeves). This box was held in an MSI-brown cardboard box with thick foam supports, alongside a second box containing the power brick. No other peripherals come with this item. Finally this was packaged into a plain shipping box alongside a strip of large air-filled bags (instead of polystyrene), with nothing on the outside identifying its contents. Overall, this was excellent packaging, the laptop suffered no damage during transit.

The build quality seems reasonable - the screen and body will flex if you are actively trying to make them do so, however I haven't noticed anything during normal use. This is most likely due to MSI designing around weight - it's very light for a 15.6'' screen, at 4.1 lbs / 1.9 kg. It does collect fingerprints, but they disappear after a quick wipe with a microfiber cloth.

Visually, I adore the black and gold look, with only the individually-lit RGB keyboard to suggest a gaming pedigree (this was easily set to a uniform white through the SteelSeries Engine software - Fn-1-0 acts as a shortcut to jump between different profiles). The keyboard is lovely to type on with a good medium weight to each key - I very quickly found myself making no more mistakes than I would on any other I'm used to using. The 1080p screen is reasonably bright with a high 144 Hz refresh rate and a good colour range (however if this is important for your own work I would advise checking the many technical reviews which calibrate the colours according to the 3 standards). The trackpad (running Synaptic drivers) was annoying at first however, it seemed to enter a click every 7 seconds or so losing focus on any drop down menus. However this disappeared after a restart and I haven't noticed any problems since. You have 2-finger scrolling up/down, and 3- and 4- finger gestures for changing between apps or controlling the volume. I did have to find a Chrome extension however to retain the two-finger swipe forward and backwards I had previously. 

Upon booting up for the first time, there is the usual Windows 10 Home introduction sequence involving Cortana, which took about 10-15 minutes to get through. I uninstalled maybe 8-10 items of bloat, nothing too hard to remove. Coming from Windows 7, the inability to have control over updates was annoying, and the laptop started to update from 1709 to 1803 (currently not deemed great) but oh well. There were 5 or so other security updates, nothing major, so it starts off close to being up to date. 

I haven't yet had the time to push the performance, but the Max-Q 1070 has been performing well on benchmarks and I have no real concerns here. The 8th generation of intel CPUs seem to perform around 30% better than the previous generation, and the USB-3 thunderbolt port offers the potential to run an external GPU if that becomes relevant in years to come. The main concern is the thermals - at high loads users have found this model to run hot! CPU undervolting offers one solution to this, as might re-pasting (this will, however, void your warranty with BestBuy according to the employee I asked so beware). Under normal conditions (for example, writing this review while surfing) the CPU is running at 44 °C, and the fans are silent.

The speakers sound fine, nothing amazing but it's a laptop. They sit underneath, but can be turned up pretty loud. The webcam is a little grainy, but will certainly suffice, and there are plenty of ports if you wanted to run a dedicated camera. One nice feature is the ability to physically turn the camera off however, for the security conscious (when enabled through the keyboard-shortcut the Windows Camera app cannot find the camera). 

The battery seems reasonable. I wouldn't want to attempt a full days work with no charger to hand, but I would have no worries about an afternoon away from mains. When plugged it during use it sat at around 90% (claiming to be plugged in but not charging) which is likely to improve the battery life by reducing the number of charge cycles the laptop goes through by not going to 100%, dropping a little bit, topping up and repeating. 6-and change hours use seems to be about what I get.

"This is a FIRST IMPRESSIONS review after a little over 2 weeks of use. Disclaimer: getting the headphones like everyone else, but really do LOVE this laptop.

If I could actually give it 4.8, I'd do that because I absolutely love this laptop, but there are a few things (mentioned elsewhere) that, while pretty fixable, are annoying. Despite this, I think this laptop is the best on the market for gaming and productivity. 4.8 is an accurate score, but relative to all others in its class, it's a 5. I'll get into pros and cons, just first a little background. 

I got this laptop after almost 7 months of weighing the pros and cons of every laptop out there. I was coming from an 8 year old macbook pro, so I was getting back into the game and wanted to thoroughly research all the options. I started with macs and quickly realized they had become dinosaurs in terms of specs for money, and looks IMO. My first and foremost requirement was the new GTX 1070 MAX Q, and so I eliminated a lot of competition with that standard (including the razor blade stealth pro which was my top pic prior, but at nearly 2300 with hella bezel, only a 1060, and iffy customer service reviews, it had to go). Next, I didn't want a gigantic, heavy gaming laptop (wanted around 15 inches or under, and under 5 lbs), so that eliminated the majority of the laptops left. What I came down to was the new Gigabyte Aero 15X 1070, and was about to buy it when this little guy was announced. With almost identical specs, a camera mounted at a normal angle, the same bezel-less sexiness, and a better look overall with its sleek gold trim and matte black (versus the pretty basic / borderline ugly Gigabyte), all for about $300 cheaper, it was an easy decision. I pulled the trigger on it a few weeks ago and have been LOVING it. 

Okay, TLDR pros and cons list: 

PROS

- GTX 1070 makes it a gaming / editing / streaming BEAST
- 144 hz refresh rate keeps things nice and smooth
- 8th gen Intel I7 processor, the best around
- Great, accurate color thanks to proprietary software 
- Great keyboard - colors, customization with SteelSeries Engine 3 and the lighter keys compared to Macbooks make typing faster and less straining on the hands for me (write for a living / carpal tunnel is a thing)
- Bezel-less AF (can never go back to bezels) 
- Top-mounted camera 
- Long battery life for both gaming and productivity (esp compared to competitors, I think it beats the Gigabyte 15x) 
- Super thin
- Super light 
- Gold trim (#fancy) 
- Super powerful
- Easy customer service 
- $300+ cheaper than any other laptop with same specs
- Although others have mentioned the heat as a con, compared to other gaming laptops it actually does really well thanks to its extra fans. It might get too hot to put on your lap, but with a cooling pad you're fine. 
- Ability to upgrade SSD and RAM (though some put the motherboard as an issue when upgrading, I know it's possible and lots have done it either DIY or with a professional)

CONS 

- MOUSEPAD needs to get its ish together. Turning off multi swipe commands helped, and I hear there are software fixes. (I also have a wireless mouse, but prefer trackpad for work). Also, maybe it's a matter of being used to the macbook pro 13"" but the trackpad is HUGE which makes it slightly annoying to go the full 3 1/2 -4 inches from left click to right click. 
- Brightness, not as bright as macbook which has been an adjustment, but I also hear there are software fixes here and possibly better on the eyes 
- No G-Sync is KIND OF a con, but the trade off is a lot longer battery life and I've heard arguments that this actually keeps the FPS higher. Also MSI has said that G-Sync is supported so possibly an option to add it after purchase (personally, I'm am 100% satisfied with the smoothness of the rig as is, and would prefer less power usage / more battery life) 
- Speakers - the speakers themselves are actually above average and are ""surround sound,"" but they are strangely located underneath the laptop which distorts the sound and I believe contributes to lower maximum volume 

Ultimately, even given the cons, this is the best portable gaming laptop out there right now, for the best price. Seriously I dare you to find these specs for this price point anywhere else. It's got the best available specs to date for a thin and light laptop (-G-sync, but again, trade offs on power) and it's also the lowest price point in its class. 10000% recommend, it's an investment I'm glad I made. And if you're worried about upgrades in tech, these laptops hold their value extremely well - last years model was selling OVER the retail price on several sites and sold immediately.

"Note: There was a note in the box that I'd get a free headset if I wrote a review. There is no requirement for what I write. I would not alter my review just for a headset. This is accurate, and honest.

My old laptop died so I went on the search for a new one. I have experience with PCs dating back to the beginning. I am the guy that friends and family call on to offer advice and help them with computer issues. So, I know my stuff.

I was very particular and critical of the type of laptop I wanted. I'm not a huge PC gamer but I like the flexibility to game if I want and I also edit photos and videos and do development work on the laptop. For the most part, I get gaming laptops for their power and ability to handle multi-threaded workloads, including graphic-oriented processing.

I tried the following laptops in addition to this one: EVGA SC15, Dell G7, Dell XPS 15. Out of all of the laptops I have tried, this one was the best. Here's why:

It is a very quiet laptop. It does not have the high-pitched fan whine that the XPS had. And, the fans spin down to either off, or a very low speed so that you really cannot hear anything.

It has great battery life. Expect somewhere between four and six hours with general, mixed use. Granted, that's not as much as the XPS, but it is far more than most gaming laptops out there. I can only think of one gaming laptop (Gigabyte) that comes close, but from what I have read the Gigabyte is supposed to be much louder than the MSI. I haven't tried it though.

It has great performance. The dual-channel 2400MHz memory, 6-core 12-thread CPU, and 1070 MaxQ all work together to help this laptop outperform the others I tried in 3DMark FireStrike, and RealBench. PassMark was close, but the SATA drive lowered that score.

The keyboard is great and the laptop has a very good selection of ports.

It is thin, light, small, and has a bezel-less screen like the XPS. It is very similar in size and weight to the XPS. The metal is a bit thinner than some gaming laptops but I still think it feels solid and I appreciate the reduced weight.

There are some downsides to this Best Buy build and to the laptop in general:

The drive is a SATA drive, not NVMe. That drug down the PassMark score. Two of the other laptops I tried had an NVMe and I do notice a slight difference with hard drive access and load times. There is a pause sometimes upon load that I didn't experience with the other PCs and I believe it has to do with the drive. 

The power connector is in an odd location and it does block the vent somewhat. However, I the cooling was still good for a laptop and it doesn't seem to be an issue.

The function keys have the key name in small letters at the top and with the keyboard lit up, you really can't see the numbers. It's not hard to figure them out, but the other keyboards I tried had the function key numbers larger and lit up.

I haven't opened the laptop up but from what I understand, you have to take the motherboard off in order to get to the other M.2 slot to add an NVMe because the motherboard is upside-down. That is a lot more work than it needs to be. And, with a slower SATA drive, I'll probably upgrade it as soon as I can.

The screen is really good but the brightness isn't as high as the XPS. There is no light bleed on mine (unlike the XPs which had some light bleed) and the high-refresh rate is good.

As a side note, if you do any performance testing make sure you check the advanced power settings. Mine was set to go into hibernate after 20 minutes when plugged in. Maybe that was a Windows default but I originally thought the PC was shutting down due to heat until I saw that.

All in all, this is a great laptop. If you don't mind taking it apart and unhooking several cables and flipping over the motherboard to upgrade the drive to an NVMe, or if you don't care about the performance hit of the SATA drive, then you should be very pleased with this. It is very much like having an XPS that can actually perform (and not throttle like the XPS does) and thus is a thin, portable laptop with great battery life and great performance for gaming, work-related tasks, and graphics/photo editing.

This laptop is about twice the price of all of the other laptops I was looking at but I think in the end, it is the best one for me since I tend to keep my laptops for a long time and this should do everything I need for years to come.",TimTx1,Best laptop I have tried so far,2,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",4
"Bought this laptop at the $1999 price and was able to use the $100 student discount offered at the time and for that price minus tax this is IMO a very capable and good looking laptop. One thing to note about the Best Buy model from what I've read is that it uses a SATA SSD instead of NVMe and an Intel Wifi card instead of a Killer card which gives it the lower price than other retailers. Not an issue for me but may matter to some.

Build Quality: This was probably the one thing I was suspect about given a lot of reviews I've seen/read. It's an all metal outer chassis with some plastic bits (screen hinge/rear exhaust panel). In two separate best buy's the palm area creaked when pressed on which I've read from some owners is a somewhat common problem. Lucky for me I've had none on my model. There is some flex to the display and the area above the keyboard by the power button. Overall I'm pleased with the build quality but don't expect macbook pro or razer unibody type sturdiness/feel. It is very light and considering how much power its packing makes it even more amazing.

Display: 1080p 144hz screen. Matte finish so less light reflections. MSI advertises it as ""IPS level"" on their website but viewing angles are good, and has good color reproduction on the rgb and adobe rgb spectrums. Gaming on it has been excellent especially when hitting those 100+ fps. I plan on using this for photo editing and some light video editing on the go.

Keyboard/Trackpad: Decent key travel/feel. The key caps feel like they're metal as well and they have individually lit RGB that you can customize. No number pad but it's nice to have your hands centered when typing. Track pad is just okay. Tracking is adequate but I've had times where it right clicks when I don't intend to.

Speakers: Bottom firing. They get decently loud and sound is good for basic use. This is assuming you're gonna use headphones for gaming. 

Performance: This thing is will handle any basic tasks you throw at it (Internet browsing, Youtube, Word processing). Overall use through out the UI is snappy and responsive. With the 144hz refresh rate Windows animations look so smooth, even just moving the mouse pointer around. Can play pretty much any AAA gaming titles out with the hardware enclosed. Played some Far Cry 5 and No Man's Sky and It's been a blast. Smooth stable performance. Fan noise is noticeable during gameplay but not too loud IMO. The areas above the keyboard do get warm.

- Like many of said this is a fingerprint magnet! Beautiful when clean but any sort of oils from your hands will smear on the outside. 
- Port selection is good. One thing I wish it had was a full size SD card slot especially since gaming laptops make very good photo/video editing machines.
- Front facing camera on the top bezel so no booger view. Quality is meh but not something I care about. There's even a dedicated button to disable the camera on the hardware level. Windows doesn't recognize the camera unless activated on.
- Battery life.

"Disclaimer: I was incentivized to write this review by the offer of a free Steelseries headset. There were no requirements for a minimum score. 

First off, this is a marvelous machine. I'm preparing to make a big move and so decided to upgrade from my 2008 Macbook Pro. I considered a broad range of notebooks, including the new Macbook Pro, the Razer Blade (2018), the Dell XPS 15, the Surface Book 2, and several others. I am not a PC gamer, but I wanted to keep the option open just in case. I needed a workhorse, with decent battery life, that could handle anything I threw at it, and something hardy enough to be a primary machine as well. after hours of research and comparison, I settled on the GS65 and ordered from Best Buy, who I felt had the best configuration for the price.

The configuration I received has the GTX 1070 Max-Q GPU, the i7 8750H CPU, 16gb of RAM and a 512GB hard drive. The notebook was packaged well, double boxed, and arrived with no damage. On taking it out of the box I immediately loved the look and feel of the body, it looks like a professional machine with personality, much better than a bland thinkpad but without the gaudy styling usually found on gaming laptops. MSI hit the nail on the head with the gold logo and accents - it's beautiful. Upon initial setup, I found the interface pleasant and easy to use. I did have quite the time uninstalling the bloatware included (I'm not even quite finished) but this wasn't anything I wasn't expecting with a new windows device. After a week or so testing things, including basic tasks, large file transfers, browsing, CPU/GPU testing, I feel very good about the machine's abilities. 

Others have noted that the build quality feels a bit less than they'd like, particularly concerning the thin aluminum and plastic used on the body. I've found that unless I'm moving the laptop around by one side with the lid open, there's no flex and no issues. It's quite the solid piece when closed, and I feel comfortable using it on the go. For reference, It's significantly lighter than my unibody Macbook pro of the same size, though I doubt it would survive a long fall like that machine has in the past. Don't drop it.
Battery life is so-so, far better when the settings are configured properly. I don't anticipate needing to be on battery alone for more than 6-7 hours, and the charging cable is also quite unobtrusive for travel. For a gaming laptop, the battery life is outstanding.

The keyboard feels great. The keys have just enough travel and a good weight to them. I've never felt more comfortable typing on a laptop. As a non-gamer, I'm also new to the RGB backlighting, which I absolutely love, particularly the ""Disco"" setting. There are subtler options available which better mesh with the more grown-up vibe this machine exudes.

The trackpad is also very well done, some say it's too stiff for their taste, but as someone who prefers the tap-to-click, it isn't an issue, and I find it no stiffer than a macbook when I do deign to click it.

The screen is excellent. The colors are sharp, the refresh rate of 144mhz is amazing for a laptop, and I've had nothing but good experiences with it thus far.

The speakers sound very good... for laptop speakers. The sound quality won't blow away any of you audiophiles out there, but it is very nice and well-balanced for everyday listening. 

The amount of ports on this machine is staggering in this age, and particularly for the size of the notebook. This was one of my chief deciding factors when purchasing. Three USB Standard, HDMI, Thunderbolt USB-C, Display, Ethernet, mic in and Hi-Fi 3.5MM Audio out. That lineup speaks for itself. Particularly, the Hi-Fi audio out should make up for any qualms one has with the onboard speakers.

Lastly, the cooling system. This notebook uses a triple-fan system, and does make a decent amount of noise. Nothing I'm not used to, but noisy nonetheless. That said, I don't find it bad enough to irritate me. I have yet to put the machine under max load, so I may update this later, but I've pushed the fan speed up once or twice with non-gaming tasks and the fans managed to cool the system well. My CPU is lightly undervolted (-50mV), and my fan profiles were tweaked on dragon center according to recommendations from online research. I have chosen to keep the stock thermal paste for now. Your mileage may vary.
In sum, the look and feel of this notebook are phenomenal, and it has managed to exceed nearly all of my expectations. I plan to use this notebook for years to come.",John,Excellent Laptop for general and specific use,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I had been looking for a new laptop for months, and considered many different sizes and models. Having used 17"" Macbook Pro, and 11"" Macbook Air, and 13"" Dell detachable, I found that for my current office and content creation needs, at 15"" would be optimal. I purchased a number but returned them for varying reasons, including HP Spectre X360 (2017 and 2018), Dell XPS 15 2017, Dell XPS 15 2-in-1, and almost a Lenovo 720 and 730. But I finally found what I was looking for in the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. My only hesitation was the price as it was considerably more expensive than all the others I tried. But it offered the least amount of compromises critical to me.

1. It's noticeably lighter than other 15"", which is noticeable both when traveling and on your lap. 
2. The screen is great. It's matte, which often doesn't have the pop of glossy screens. But this is plenty bright, with great colors. Plus no reflections now. Best matte screen I've seen.
3. Keyboard is comfortable. Many of the others I tried have shallow, low-travel keys. They're not terrible, but they're different and not as comfortable as the MSI's normal keys. I also like that there's no num pad included so that the trackpad and keyboard are centered on the screen, unlike the new HP Spectre 2018. I like how the keyboard is towards the bottom of the deck, so my wrists are cutting into the edge, as they do on most 15"" laptops. By the end of the day I have red edge imprints on both wrists. No problem with this one.
4. Trackpad is good and is Windows Precision. Responsive without any issues so far.
5. Webcam is at the top of the screen, unlike some others at the bottom. I'm in video conference calls often, and the bottom webcams are terrible for this.
6. Super powerful. I'm not a gamer, but I do Adobe content creation. I finally have a laptop more powerful than my 5 year old workstation desktop.
7. Quiet. For most office related work, the fans are silent and it runs cool. 
8. Sound is clear and loud enough. For common use, occasional web video, it's more than sufficient. 
9. Design is classy and elegant. Black metal with gold accents. There's some creakiness in the joints, as the metal is thin, but this probably keeps its weight down. A fine trade off to me.
10. Battery life is relatively good. I've read that most gaming laptops fare poorly in battery life, or are big and heavy to house a larger battery. I get about 6 hours of common use (not gaming). It's not great, and not the level of the 11"" and 13"" low power laptops I have, but it gets you through most of a day.

I had never bought a gaming laptop, and never an MSI before. But I'm really impressed, and happy after a long search. I have a hard time imagining someone being unhappy with this machine.",jiggpuff,Almost Perfect,13,3,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"*Disclaimer: I am writing my review for a free pair of STEELSERIES SIBERIA 200 HEADSET but I will not let this impact my review.

To start off I think it has to be said that my specific laptop came with problems from day one. I noticed the first issue when I was setting up my Microsoft Account. It asked me for my birthday and when I would move the cursor to select the month/date/year, it would close before I was even able to click. It seemed as if someone else was using an invisible cursor to click outside the selection area and close it. It took me 30 minutes to finally select my birthday. I updated all the drivers and it still seems to click random things. Now I just use my mouse and disabled the touch pad when it's plugged in.

My second problem was when I tried to use the FN + another key such as home (to change rgb lighting effect), brightness up/down keys, volume up/down keys etc. I have updated the SteelSeries Engine 3 to no avail. 

My third problem is that the sound does not work intermittently. For example today I was watching Netflix just fine and then a few hours later I started playing some games. At one point the sound just would not work. I tried to use the FN + up arrow key which don't work. Then went into settings in both the games and windows and turned up the volume. It doesn't work. I have updated the drivers for the speakers and it does not seem to have done anything. 

I am going to back to BB to return the laptop for another GS 65 or have Geek Squad fix the issues as I have the warranty. But it is upsetting because the laptop has so many issues out of the gate. 

Other than these issues I absolutely love the laptop. The keyboard is nice, it has good feedback and the keys are far enough apart. I'm glad MSI didn't cram a number pad in there like the GS 63 because it really allowed them to make a nicer layout. Typing was hard on my friend's GS 63 as I have large hands but on the GS 65 it is so much better. 

As far as the screen goes, its gorgeous. So far I have played Forza 7, PUBG, and COD Black Ops 4 Beta. Each game looked amazing, the colors were rich and vibrant. This screen is pretty bright too. It doesn't get hard to tell what's going on even when the game/video goes very dark. 

The thing bezel really makes the screen look bigger than it actually is. I actually thought the GS 63 screen was smaller but evidently they are the same size.

I'm not gonna go into the specs of the laptop as you can just look it up, but I have been able to play all three games so far at mostly Ultra settings and get good frame rates. 

The Battery on this laptop is amazing. I spent 6 hours on it just watching Netflix and browsing the web. I had the brightness down to about 40% but it was also late at night so take that as you will. It's a serious upgrade from the GS 63's 3-4 hours of battery life. 

People who review this always bash on the laptop's ""build quality"" but I'd say it's pretty sturdy. There is some flex in the vents above the keyboard when you press down on it hard, but who does that during normal use? There is also some flex in the screen but it's barely noticeable. Don't let all those harsh reviews of the build quality of this laptop deter you from buying this. I mean this is a 4lb gaming laptop with a big 80+ wh battery. They had to cut weight somewhere, and that was in the screen and the lighter metal. 

Overall I'd rate this a 3.5 right now because of all the issues but I gave it a 4 because I really love this laptop otherwise. I will edit my review after I go to BB and see what they do to help me. If you're on the edge about this laptop, just pull the trigger.

"Besides being a beautiful beast, it is also a somewhat cooler beast according to forums...I hear about thermals in the 70's, CPU and GPU. After running it for at least six hours, I noticed some warming up while doing some DSP work on it and watching some you-tube. I have not used it extensively for gaming. I'm mainly using it as my audio processing desktop replacer and mixing, production and editing machine. It will also be used for video editing from my modulars synths channel. I like the form factor better than the lighter MSI in almost the same class. MSI just looked a bit flimsy, cork on the bottom ?! The MSI screen a bit bendable, something I'm afraid I might break, but not the Alienware which is built like a tank. I like the color scheme changer, the rear fed power adapter jack, but not the lack of a gradual fade-in/fade-out factor, unless I'm missing something. The lack of an SD Card is simply unacceptable in my opinion! I have an USB SD Card hub, but still an Dell oversight...What were thy thinking ? An extra USB 3.0 port or two would have made this even better. I love the keyboard and the crisp, almost glare proof display. Time will tell how the heavy construction build will play out. So far so good. It is gorgeous and flashing like TRON or X-mas Tree which ever you happen to prefer, yet still a bit warm after long periods of time moving towards the key-bed area where you might sense some gradual warmth, which is probably not something preferable for some users. It's a hit and miss loving it completely. I have a feeling the thermals will go up during an intensive game with overclocking turned on from the control center. I love it so far, its too new to give it 100% pure time-tested opinion, but it is what it is.

Pros- 
Beautiful Display for being 60Hz. The tones are amazing and the G-Sync just makes everything pop. 
Sound is absolutely stunning and better than any laptop I have ever heard. Hands down beautiful when gaming or listening to music 
Design - Is flawless, its beautiful, seamless, and the keyboard feel is truly something to try out. The weight fo the laptop gets comfortable and its SOOOOOOOO quiet even when playing heavy games like Wolfenstien and Shadows of War. 

Cons- The battery life is still not on par with where batteries should be today but thats comes on course with the system being so powerful.

"Initially I was somewhat reluctant about getting the Alienware 17 R5 vs getting its predecessor the R4, but reckoned after all that the upgraded specs ( incl. now GSYNC etc) are worth paying the higher pricel ( Still Got item pricematched and saved another 270.00$ of 1899.99 !)

It is a gaming powerhouse, no doubt. I am impressed with how well it is built, how well it performs when playing games or doing other tasks and how relatively subtle the fan noise emission is. Even under load it is never overbearing or annoying as with other gaming laptops ( hissing or loud fan noise !). Thanks to the Nvidia GTX 1070 with its 8Gb VRAM and Vapor cooling , and the I7 8th Gen Proc, this machine can render all your games at max settings, while staying cool without breaking into a sweat.

"I have been gaming for as many years as I can remember, but it has always been on a desktop.

"Make no mistake, this is a gaming laptop. It’s big, heavy (5lb 8oz), has middling battery life, and compared to ultrabooks it’s thick. It has some garrish flares that might scare off the more conservative laptop buyer, and comes with a folder full of stickers with text like “Join the Republic”. But beyond all the gaming hubbub, this is a solid machine and solid value.

Overall Build:

The build overall is solid. The lid is nice asymmetrically brushed aluminum finish that while attracting fingerprints, does give a nice appearance. It’s broken up by Asus’s republic of gamers logo, which appears reflective until the screen is on, at which point it glows red.

The top body is made from aluminum, which keeps it from flexing. Because the casing is aluminum it feels quite premium. The materials however, do make the laptop quite heavy, weighting in at 5.5lbs. Even in a 15.6” laptop, this weight is significant.

The keyboard is quite nice. The keys have a decent amount of travel, but are quite quiet without feeling squishy. This translates into a very comfortable keyboard to both type and game on. I was able to easily hit 82 WPM without any adjustment period (high 80s is my best case scenario). Most keys are solid black all the way around with transparent letters for the backlight. The WASD keys are set-off from the rest with translucent sides. The W key as a little nib so as to allow you to easily orient yourself to the WASD quad. The space bar is slightly larger on the left side, as to allow more comfort for long FPS session (it did not interfere with day to day typing). The CTRL key on the left side is the leftmost bottom row key. The top row provides various extra functions, such as media control, fan control, screen brightness, etc. There are 4 dedicated keys above the left side of the keyboard that also control volume and launch the ROG gaming center. The power button is a key located above the number pad. It’s nice that the power button is placed as to avoid the laptop from accidentally turning on while in a bag. The keyboard area is slightly sunken in to avoid the keys touching the screen. There are 4 zones of LED backlighting, which can provide a rainbow effect. I set mine to solid color, but there are also 6 other effects, ranging from breathing to music strobing. The software even allows you to sync with other Aura compatible components to keep you color coordinated. 

The power connector is located on the left side (right handers rejoice!) along with an HDMI, 3 USB 3.1 ports and a headphone jack. The right side is much simpler with only a USB 3.1 and USB-C port (Gen 2). The edges of the aluminum unibody are chamfered and finished in a bronze color. The adds just a touch of color while avoiding any sharp edges that would otherwise dig into your wrists.

Essentially the entire back third of the chassis is dedicated to cooling. Fans are adjustable in the ROG software. There are 3 fan profiles out of the box, quiet, standard, and overboost. Standard is a ok balance, but if you’re just browsing or other intermittent load you may as well just switch it to silent. Standard keeps the fans running at a decent speed keeping everything cool. Any profile ramps up in any mode if the CPU and GPU are too stressed. These profiles can affect performance on and off battery. Specifically I found the CPU would stay around its base frequency 2.2GHz on battery with all threads loaded unless you set the power profile to “Best Performance”. Plugged in the CPU would boost up to 3.8-4.2 GHz. Depending on your sensitivity to noise, you may want to default to the ‘silent’ setting and either use the hotkey or software to crank the fans up if gaming.

Performance:

The highlight of the GU501GM is the new 8th generation Coffee Lake CPU - the i7-8750H. It brings with it 6 cores, 12 threads of processing power that turbos up to 4.2GHz. On battery the default profiles will keep its turbos down, but plugged in this powerhouse CPU can tear through just about anything you throw at it. It eats my work laptop’s (a Surface Book 2 15”) lunch, besting it’s i7-8650u by nearly 50% in many benchmarks. Now the target TDP of 45w is a far cry from the 15w TDP of the ‘u’ series, so the performance difference is somewhat expected, but keep in mind,even compared to the i7-7700hq and i7-6700hq, this is a significant increase in performance.

The GPU is the venerable Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB. While aging, it still represents the upper mid-range market for gaming laptops, and is on par with a desktop GTX 970 and performs quite close to its desktop brethren. I say aging, because the first GTX 1060 laptops came out late 2016, but with Nvidia Volta still off in the horizon, it’s the only option that blends a sleek chassis and great performance. And make no doubt, it does perform great. With the included 1080p screen, a workable framework will almost always be achievable even with most of the goodies turned up. The GTX 1060 pared with a 1080p screen will have many years of use in it.

It should be said that the fan profiles can really affect performance here. Comparing the silent and overboost profiles, it’s clear that overboost allows the GPU much more headroom. A 3DMark run of Fire Strike yielded 8713 on stanard and a whopping 10353 on overboost. It’s very encouraging to see the cooling solution perform so well, allowing it to break 10k in Fire Strike.

Display:

So this is a Best Buy exclusive model, and one of the places that is cut compared to the GM501 model (found at other retailers) is the screen. This model is a AHVA IPS screen at 120Hz (panel is: AUO45ED). It’s only 72% NTSC color gamut, and it’s brightness is limited. It also lacks G-Sync capabilities and 144Hz that the GM501 models have. Now, this is still an upgrade from many a mid-range laptop, which only include 60Hz panels. Overall the screen does 120Hz quite well. If you’re into e-sports shooters, this will be a killer feature. Response time is seems adequate and I noticed no ghosting. One thing you may notice is that by default, the Intel GPU will switch refresh rates on battery down to 60Hz. This appears to be another battery optimization.

Sound:

In a word, the sound is nice. It’s not amazing, but it’s one of the more solid thin gaming laptop I’ve heard. Bass drops off quickly at a distance, but if you’re sitting close, the sound is pretty well balanced. It’s excellent for gaming session, but a bit more limited if you’re listening to music. The speakers are downward facing on each side and this arrangement works pretty well due to how the bottom is angled.

Battery:

The GU501 includes a 55 Wh battery. While nothing to sneeze at, it won’t keep the 45w CPU and 80w GPU fed for long. That said, due to the various battery optimizations, out of the box it can pull at least 3-4 hours of web browsing, perhaps more if you turned the screen brightness down. Given the laptop’s performance focus I believe this is a tradeoff the target market can live with. Gaming on battery can work, but I saw faster than 1% a minute drop - even w/ 30FPS/downclocked OOTB settings.

Storage:

The GU501 model only includes a 128GB SATA M.2 SSD. The model included was a Kingston RBUSNS8154p3128, and while only being SATA, it performed admirably. I’m not sure how, but the drive was able to sequentially read at 1400+ MB/s (limit should be around 550MB/s). Write speeds were definitely in line with SATA at around 400MB/s. The biggest limiting factor here is the size. At only 128GB, it’s probably best left as the OS drive. Also included is a 1TB Seagate Barracuda hybrid drive. The hybrid drive has 8GB of NAND to serve as cache, but performance is as you’d expect from a spinning drive. This setup is certainly workable, but with NAND prices finally falling, I’d probably consider an upgrade. Which leads me to…

Upgrability:

The GU501 has 13 Torx T-5 screws on the back plastic cover. Once the screws are removed, the back cover can be gently pried (I used a small flat head screwdriver) up around the plastic hinge. Once the initial ‘pop’ of the plastic clip by the hinge occurs, the backing comes off with almost no effort. Underneath the cover you’ll find access to all major replaceable components: WiFi card, RAM, SATA drive, M.2 2280 slot, and even easy access to CPU/GPU if the time comes for a repaste. It was encouraging to see warranty void stickers on certain components (like the CPU cooler), but nothing impeding you from upgrading RAM/Storage. In fact, the GU501GM has 1 RAM slot populated, and another open, ready to receive another 16GB stick to become a 32GB monster. The M.2 slot should accept PCIe NVMe, just like it’s GM501 brother. All in all, this makes this laptop quite future proof in my opinion.

Conclusion:

If you’re looking for a solid gaming laptop under $1500, then look no further. You get a great combination of performance, build quality, and customizability. What faults I can find, are rectifiable through later upgrades to storage.",aarondr,A Solid Build with Performance to Spare,66,3,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5
"Here’s my 1 month use summary of owning the machine.

DAY TO DAY:
I've been pretty amazed at the performance of this laptop since I got it a month ago. The 6-core CPU breezes through all my tasks and my work, although there are some hiccups (little lags) along the way. It's not as bad as you might expect but it's still annoying if you're working and it just does that hiccup. Sometimes it recovers, sometimes not. With a hefty weight of 5.5 lbs, this isn't your regular thin and light. Given the weight, it is still portable enough to be carried around in a backpack. It's not uncomfortably heavy and bulky, but you'll need the power adapter in the pack as well because the battery isn't really the laptop's strength.

FANS AND NOISE
Fan Overboost found in the ROG Gaming Center gives you 3 different fan speeds, Silent, Balanced and Overboost. Overboost I think isn't helpful because it's too loud and it probably adds heat to the system because the fan is spinning at a higher rate. Balanced is something that I use often when playing, and Silent is my default when just working, and doing casual things. Balanced and Overboost sound like airplanes getting ready for take off. Balanced isn't that loud, but Overboost... It's loud enough but can still be drowned out by using headphones. Also, the fans are always on, even in Silent mode.

HEAT
Sadly, this laptop does not have the rising bottom flap that its more expensive siblings have. The bottom panel has grills for air to come in and out, and some rubber feet to elevate the machine. The heat? Meh. It's a gaming laptop for crying out loud! Which the fans will do if you set it to Overboost! I mean, loud fans, and heat are staple identities of gaming laptops. With Gore developing cooling solutions for Dell, and the rise of the vapor chambers, I'm sure gaming laptop heat problems will be a thing of the past, but for now, we can always undervolt. re-paste, or use cooling pads.

WORK
My recent workload consists of doing animation in Flash and Spine and some drawing work in Photoshop. The performance of the laptop while working has been top notch ever since I got this as the replacement of the q535ud. The 1080p screen resolution means that I don't need to adjust UI scaling for Photoshop and Spine. I plug in my Huion GT-156D, which is also 1080p, when I want to draw. Setting up was just plug, install the driver and play. I wanted to use my Intuos tablet paired with this laptop but Windows Ink would not cooperate with Wacom drivers, so I had to give up. Palm rejection needs a little work as well. I find myself turning off the touch pad every once in a while if I want to rest my palms while typing. Of course, this is when I have a mouse plugged in.

PLAY
I am pleased to say that most of the games that I play runs well. I play Destiny 2 and Diablo 3 most of the time. Destiny 2 makes the laptop a little bit warm. I got about 75-90 frames average and the max temp that I saw through HWInfo was 90degrees C while Diablo 3 reached at about 85. It could be just a spike, because if it held at 90, the laptop would've throttled. This is all with the balanced fan setting. I played PUBG for 30 minutes (2 games of approx 15 min each, no wins) and it never choked on me. Overwatch reached 80 degrees on high settings but the framerate held above 100. Everything was buttery smooth thanks in part to the 120hz display. This laptop can basically handle most games at medium to high setting on 1080p.

BATTERY LIFE
The GU501GM only has a 55-Whr battery. This is its weakest link. Even the higher end GM501 has the same battery. I don't know what ASUS was thinking when they decided to pick this one. Longest that I can get is 3.5-4 hrs half brightness, keyboard backlight off, screen at 60hz. So you have to bring the 180W power adapter. The only thing going for this device is Nvidia Optimus. It is a mixed bag for some but for me I like saving battery life when I'm unplugged. So when you unplug the device, the screen turns off of a bit, then turns back on again, switching to the Intel UHD 630, and then restarting the display at 60hz. People with the GM501 with the AAS do not have this feature and have to do it though the ROG Gaming Center, which will require a restart.

KEYBOARD
Keyboard is great. I'm not really particular about the depth and the actuation force since I am a heavy typer. It's definitely not as light as my Logitech G810, but it works. I'm just also used to a more central layout instead of a left-leaning one because of the numpad. I found myself missing the backspace and pressing the numlock key and sometimes I press the enter key instead of the shift. I also occasionally miss the arrow keys and hit the num0 key. This keyboard has a back light as well you can adjust it through the ASUS ROG Aura Core. It has 4 lighting zones and you can choose any color from the RGB spectrum.

DISPLAY
The display is a Full HD, 120hz IPS Panel. It is in the average color accuracy but the brightness is good enough. The only thing that I see with regards to the display that could potentially be a downside are the bezels. I mean, the competition as super thin bezels but this one doesn't. I mean, I don't really care. For the past month that I've been using this laptop, it really has not bothered me at all. Colors are ok. Great in games and in normal use, but for work it is sometimes washed out. I do animation and drawing, and sometimes I have to rely on the hexcodes to get the right color. There is little to no light bleed and the 120hz screen is a charm. Possibly the best feature of this display. The 120hz only turns on when the machine is plugged though. Otherwise, Optimus will kick in and reduce the display frequency to 60hz. It is an automatic feature and this specific feature isn't available on the higher tier models. There's also an HD webcam on the top bezel and I'm pretty sure it's the same as every laptops' webcam.

STORAGE
Another low point of this version of the Zephyrus is the storage. I am glad they didn't cut corners anywhere else. This spec only has 128GB M.2 SSD and a 1 TB 5400rpm spinner. It isn't that bad, but some laptops at least have a 256GB for their primary but the downside is that they're probably thicker, screen is probably not 120hz and it also probably has a lesser quality build. The quality of the SSD isn't that bad. It loads Windows fast and does copying and pasting well. I recommend upgrading when you have the budget.

CHASSIS
The build quality of this laptop is solid. I love how it feels and how you know that it's 5.5lb isn't just the internals. This Zephyrus is missing the bottom flap (AAS) but the design is identical to the rest of it's family. Black with copper(bronze) accents, brushed aluminum lid, and hard plastic on the main body. There's no gamer red except for the ROG logo on the lid, and the power LED on the keyboard panel. The lid has a cutout on the bottom middle so that when you close it, you'll still see the status LEDs situated on the top middle of the keyboard. There are 13 screws that hold the bottom panel and the internals in place. Removing these will grant you access to the M.2 SSD, the HDD, RAM and the Wi-Fi card. The chassis comes with 4 USB 3.1 Type-A ports and a USB Type-C with Thunderbolt, HDMI 2.0. They've also changed the keyboard layout to a standard one with the Numpad on the right instead of a dynamic touch pad, and placed the touch pad on the default position.
Overall, I can say that I am pleased with the design and build quality for the price. 
 
TOUCH PAD
The touch pad is a little small compared to other laptops out there. Reason is that they gave enough space above the keyboard for cooling. Touch pad is too smooth and sometimes too sensitive as well. And since it's not centered but a little bit to the left, I often 0find myself hitting the right-click area of the touchpad instead of the left. Otherwise it's a great touch pad. It uses Windows Precision and works as intended.

SPEAKERS
They are louder than I expected. The full blast of these speakers will fully drown out the Overboost of the fan. Well, not really, but it's really loud. It isn't perfect sounding but they're great for what they are. It also sounds like it has a subwoofer. Just a side note though, depending on what music you're listening too, or movie you're watching, raising the volume above 60% can cause the keyboard area to vibrate and the sounds would we distorted. Ideal volume is 30-50%.

CONCLUSION
Amazing. I never thought I'd buy an ASUS ROG laptop and will love it. They've come a long way from designing a gamerish looking beast of a machine to something sleek without sacrificing the performance. Granted that the specs of this gaming underdog isn't over the top, and is limited by not having the AAS, this laptop will still blow you away. Maybe not too far. Battery life is also something to consider. With only 4-4.5 hrs of usable power, it could be the biggest drawback, or maybe a deal-breaker for some. The heat and fan noise is also to consider but why will you buy a gaming laptop if you're not going to use it's power? Priced at $1499 in the US, I can say that this machine is well worth it. I just wonder if there is a similar priced and spec'd model for the market outside of the US since this one is particularly a US Best Buy exclusive.

This ASUS gaming laptop is what I have been looking for... Fortnite Battle Royale, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Rocket League are the games being played the most. This laptop comes in a box in a fancy box. Pretty sweet packing job. Package includes the PC, power adapter brick/cord, stickers, key chain, and pamphlets.

Rather than go over ALL the specs which you can already find on this Bestbuy.com page, I'll try to give more observations of those specs instead. 
 
PROS:
-----------
* Great-looking laptop. Keys light up and change color from left to right.
* Solid feel, well-built construction. Keyboard is solid with little/no flexing.
* PC is built for speed which I do like. 
* I have played all 3 games listed above, and I honestly don't have any issues with latency and graphics. I DO have to wear over-the-ear headphones to drown out the fan noise (see below - CONS), but the graphics and movement of the screen graphics is what it's all about. The specs claim a 120Hz refresh rate and it seems up to par.
* Rocket League is probably the most graphics-intensive game I play, and most of the movement was seamless/smooth.
* Connectivity was a cinch to wi-fi. I was able to hook up to 5MHz channel with ease. Installation of updates and programs was quick.
* Boot-up time was incredibly fast.
* Plenty of 3.0 USB ports (4). No one wants to have to hook up a USB hub. All inputs are on left side except 1 USB & 1 Thunderbolt port which gives more room for mouse.
* Built-in speakers actually sound better than even high-end laptops. The sound really surprised me in a good way.
* PC comes with 16GB DDR4 RAM and upgradeable to 32GB. This will be a viable option to take advantage of in the near future. Also comes with the latest in 8th-gen intel i7 processors - the 8750H - which really flies.
* BT devices (headphones, keyboard, mouse) all connect seamlessly and work great. Absolutely no latency with the Logitech input devices I used... and Sony BT headphones.
* Quick accessibility to dedicated volume buttons (usually embedded in a Fn button). The MUTE function is in the Fn button area though.

CONS:
-----------
* With the smallest of tasks, it seems like it's working hard due to the fans always coming on. The simple task of downloading updates cause the fans to run in excess.
* FAN AGAIN... Perhaps this is the goal of the PC - to try and ALWAYS keep the inside cool because the fan really hardly ever stops when playing online. It's not going to blow up, but it feels like it. On the bright side, the PC doesn't get overheated where your palms sit... so that's a positive.
* Because of the fan, you will want to wear noise-cancelling headphones. Even desktop speakers (at times) can get overshadowed by the constant fan noise.
* Battery life will shrink quickly due to excessive fan use.

OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
----------- 
* Keys are a bit small on the right side (numeric keypad, arrow keys)... however, if you use a full-size BT keyboard/mouse, you'll be ok.
* I have not tried anything VR-related, but it does state it is VR-Ready. Unable to vouch for VR performance.
* I used Skype at the last minute so I could test out the camera, and it worked fine. Very little-to-no latency with the other party. Video was crisp. Picture on their end (they said) was very clear.
* To keep the PC minimal, an optical drive is not built-in to the unit. With all of the downloadable games today & USB/SD-cards taking over, optical drives will become more scarce.
* Screen is 1920x1080.... so NOT 4K. However, at this size, 4K isn't needed, and speed is improved with staying at 1080. ASUS made a good choice here to avoid latency issues.
* The PC is already pretty fast and includes a 1TB ""Hybrid"" SSHD (8GB of ""SSD"" built-in). I'm not really seeing much difference in performance due to this feature but perhaps over time, it will help.

CONCLUSION:
=====================
This is one of the new low-end gaming laptops that ASUS is offering this year. The more expensive versions offer up a better GPU (GeForce GTX 1070) and 256SSD. That may be a good upgrade, but unless then fan usage changes, you may want to stick with this model as movement and online play is quite good. I would like to know why the fans are used as much as they are though. They are quite loud, and perhaps that's by design in order to keep things as cool as possible. However, for gaming, it's also good to be able to play with headphones on and not annoy people around you with fan noise. This is a good PC with great performance. ASUS is on the right path here as they continue making high-quality PCs... It would be nice to see what can be done about keeping the unit cool without so much fan usage.",BADog,"Good price, good performance, SOLID",6,1,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",4
"The first thing you notice is the impressive build quality. The casing is made of brushed black aluminum that allows it to be light yet also strong. The laptop felt sturdy with no flex. The screen is bright, vibrant and has a matte finish so you won’t be bothered by glare. The keyboard is responsive and has a good feel. I’m a software programmer and the layout of the keyboard seems good for both programming and for games. One problem I’ve encountered with the layout is that I keep hitting the F12 key instead of the Delete key.

According to the utility CPU-Z, it comes with 16 GBytes of Hyundai DDR4-2666 in a single channel configuration.

The utility CrystalDiskInfo indicates that the main OS drive is a 128 GB Kingston RBUSNS8154P3128GJ SSD and communicates using the NVM Express 1.2 interface with a PCIe 3.0 x2 transfer mode. According to the specs, it’s supposed to be using the slower M.2 SATA mode so this is an unexpected and nice surprise if true.

Results from CrystalMark indicate a read speed of 1499.9 MB/s for the Seq Q32T1 test which seem to confirm it is indeed using the faster M.2 MVM Express 1.2 protocol since the M.2 SATA protocol’s maximum is about 550 MB/s.

There is also a 1 TB Seagate FireCuda Gaming SSHD that helps offset the relatively small size of the main drive. This drive can be used to store most programs, games, and data.

This is my first gaming laptop and it is actually more powerful than my desktop computer. I was surprised by how light and thin it was. Some reviewers have mentioned that they felt it was a bit on the heavy side, but my previous laptops were bulkier and about the same weight but much less powerful. So, for me, this is actually a pretty light laptop considering the beastly hardware inside that can play all my games better than my current desktop.

The first thing I did was to install some of my games like Witcher 3 and Mass Effect Andromeda. In Witcher 3, the framerate was locked at 60 fps and Mass Effect had framerates that ranged from 150 to 80 fps. Very impressive. The built-in speakers was loud and very good from such a thin laptop. During gameplay, I could hear the fans rev up fairly loud but it wasn’t too distracting for me. When performing non-gaming activities such as web browsing, the laptop was very quiet with the occasional light whisper of turning on and off of the fans.

It supports the newest wireless-AC standard which was able to maintain a strong 780.0 to 866.7 Mbps connection to my Linksys Velop WiFi Mesh router. Transferring files wirelessly from my NAS showed a solid transfer rate from 35 to 40 MB/seconds.

Bluetooth comes standard and I was able to use my HP Touch Bluetooth mouse with no problems.

This is really a great laptop. It’s more powerful than many desktops so it offers first rate portable gaming and can be used as a main desktop replacement. The only criticism I have is the relatively small 128 GB SSD for the main OS drive. The inclusion of a secondary 1TB 5400 spinning HD helps elevate this but some programs like Visual Studio will take up a lot of space on the C: drive even if you instruct it to be installed on the D: drive. For this use case, the 128 GB SSD is a little too small. 

Luckily, another reviewer has shown that it is possible to upgrade the internals of the laptop with a larger SSD and adding more memory (pictures show that there is another slot for adding memory). This upgrade might be too intimidating for a lot of users (you need a Torx screwdriver and you need to carefully pop the lid) and this includes me for the initial time. This laptop is just so beautiful that I probably won’t try upgrading memory or the SSD until I’ve had it for awhile for fear of damaging it while trying to remove the lid. But it’s nice to know that it will be possible to upgrade memory and replace the SSD with something larger if the need arises.",DoctorHoo,Awesome Gaming Laptop,3,2,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5
"This Asus GU501 ROG Laptop is the one you want. It's got everything a gamer needs, and then some. It strikes a nice balance between elegance and gaming oriented, where style is concerned. It's got enough power to push through for the next couple of years. It's thin, and doesn't weigh much.The only overall drawbacks here are battery life, no G-SYNC tech, and big bezel. Like I said, almost perfect, but still five stars. 

For starters, this laptop is honestly a looker. Featuring only one big chrome logo (that lights up red) on top of a brushed aluminum case, it looks good. Like, really good. The full laptop is aluminum, save for the bottom of the case (for cooling reasons), and features a nice gold accent trip along the outer shell. 

The keyboard features four zone lighting areas, and all are RGB, meaning colors can be changed or turned off. It houses a full sized keyboard, that feel pretty good for the most part. Actuation is good, and typing was better than on my wife's chiclet MacBook Pro 2015. The only real non-looker areas here are the screen's bezel. On the sizes, it's about 3/4 inch thick, while on top measures in around a full inch. I understand why it's there (just due to the full size keyboard), but still could be distracting for some.

The screen itself is a solid, 120hz IPS anti-glare, which I really like. It loses some of the shine that glossy screens provide with color content, but overall is better for strictly gaming. I found the screen to be goo

Moving on, let's talk internals, because this is a gaming laptop. Featuring Intel's 8th gen hex (6) Core i7 processor, this thing is a beast. That's all that needs to be mentioned there. The RAM is adequate at 16 GB, but can easily be upgraded within the second DIMM slot. The SSD and 1TB HDD were sufficient enough, although my sleep boot times were a little wonky-every time I would open my laptop, the booting would take longer than expected to happen. 

Of course, the backbone of this system is the full-size NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1060 6GB. It handles games great, and can play pretty much any games at 1080p 60FPS+. Realistically, this can do it all, and you won't have issues with games. Older games like BF4 can easily do 100+FPS. and that's perfect performance here. You know what you're getting with a 1080p screen and a GTX 1060. 

All this said, the only things that really drag the system down are the overall battery life, fan speed and noise, and the lack of G-SYNC tech in the screen. The battery life, for me after 6 days of use, hovered around 3 hours, not gaming, unplugged. When gaming, I could hit around 1hr50min unplugged. This isn't terrible, but man it can be a drag. The power brick is bigger, and weighs about 1 lb itself, making it hard to cut the cord, so to speak. 

When under any heavy loads (or even just random times) the fans really crank the speed and noise up. This isn't an issue for me, especially when using headphones, but it could be for some. Knowing that going in is essential. Lastly, no G-SYNC (as the higher end models of this computer have) is a minus, but not a killer downgrade. There are far more expensive machines that don't have the same tech, so no biggie. 

All in all, I was truly impressed with this laptop. Asus did a very nice job of bringing sophistication and sharp, gaming roots into one computer. Everything works like it should, wrapped up in a lighter (5.5 lbs) and thinner (.78in thick) package than a 15.6"" system could do. This has my approval, and is almost on par with my desktop at home now. Would definitely recommend.",DarthNeyehilus,Almost Perfect Mid-Level Gaming Laptop,1,0,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5
"FIRST IMPRESSIONS
The packaging is impressive… open the generic cardboard box and you will find a rather interesting container that, when opened, pushes the laptop up toward you with a hinged back to the box. This makes getting the plastic wrapped laptop easy to pull out of the protective container. Underneath, you will find a small compartment that houses the documentation for the machine.

The “notebook” itself is covered in a black, brushed finish that runs in two directions, diagonally along the cover with the ROG logo that lights up when powered on. Right off I notice the three lights at the center for power, battery and hard drive access… some of which have been sorely lacking from recent notebook computers. 

USAGE
Size - The notebook itself is slightly smaller in footprint than my old Dell XPS 17, but it is much thinner. I would have traded a few millimeters for a bit better cooling, but with the overheating safeguards that are in place, it keeps adjusting itself to stay just cool enough. 

Weight - I expected a “notebook” computer to be a bit lighter than this, although the specs of this machine almost demand more heft. After a few longer 3D sessions, it does get a bit warm and I found myself checking the gaming app to make sure the temps were not going to fry the poor thing! In several of the benchmark runs, it did slow down slightly as the temps reached high enough to demand it. We will see how things go as the cooling fins and other components get coated with dust during regular use.

Performance -With 16GB of RAM and both an SSD and a hybrid hard drive, performance in Windows is very quick, as I expected. I had upgraded my XPS several times to faster drives and finally SSDs, so it performed as I would have expected. The i7 performs very well with all the apps I have thrown at it so far. I am amazed at the speed every time I run one of my games at the highest settings! I used to run them at medium and I get an entirely new experience with seeing them as the developers wanted them to look.

Keyboard - It took a bit to get used to the keyboard, I’m not sure why laptop manufacturers can’t settle on a standard layout! I use the “Home” and “End” keys a lot in my work, and having them on the same physical key requires a FN key press to toggle the “End” function. Aside from the times I will be using it away from my desk, it will probably have an external keyboard attached, so this is not as big a deal as it could be. The backlit keyboard feels pretty good, especially for a notebook computer, and there are dedicated volume, microphone and ASUS app keys at the top. The W-A-S-D keys have a slightly larger lit area, so they stand out in a dimly lit room and the W key has a small bump on it to help tactile feel during those intense sessions. The colors and intensity can be adjusted to taste, I have it set to reflect the current temps and it changes constantly from a green to yellow to red to reflect how warm the machine is running.

Software - After the normal Windows 10 setup procedure, it was off and running very well. There is a bit of bloatware, but much of that is Windows 10 itself, not ASUS. They have kept their installed software to just a few apps and they focus more on the gaming and performance aspects of the machine.

FINAL THOUGHTS
I have had some issues dealing with product quality and ASUS customer service related to some of our other computers recently, but that has been an exception to the quality I have seen form ASUS over the years. As with most companies, there are bound to be flaws in some models that don’t reflect their normal quality. The finish on this machine is excellent, the screen looks very bright and clear and all the keys and buttons are responsive in normal use. The trackpad is what I would expect on any modern mobile computer, and responds well to multi-touch movements.

I can’t wait to throw more apps and games at it over the next few months to see just how well it outperforms my other machines. It is just the right size to carry with me all day.",Andy,"A very capable ""notebook"" gaming computer",3,0,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5
"Good price point and very polished look with just the right amount of sizzle….

As a more mature gamer, I like having good quality equipment that is tasteful in appearance for daily use but still has enough “sizzle” to stand out from the crowd. This laptop fits the requirements, and is a good BB ‘private label’ model to steer you towards BestBuy to get a premium gaming laptop at a very nice price point. Best Buy made a good marketing decision on what to keep on this machine to keep the performance high and save a few hundred bucks off the price of the similar ASUS model.

The pictures I saw of the laptop before seeing it in person did not do it justice. I was expecting kind of a “plastic case” appearance, but in the hands the machine feels very solid with a nice brushed finish on the metal case. The overall look is of a well-built and nicely styled laptop, very slim in appearance with some nicely stated color accents around the edges and the illuminated ROG logo on the lid. The ROG logo is one of the “sizzle” features that makes this laptop stand out (tastefully) in the crowd. The RGB keyboard really adds the final “pop” – quite eye-catching and very programmable. If it is too much for the occasion (as in school or office use) then the keyboard RGB effects can be turned off or put on single color just as a standard backlit keyboard. The 5.5 pound weight is not that much different from most laptops of the same size, and actually much less in the hand than other gaming laptops I have looked at. Final comments here are don’t go by the picture, see if you can get your hands on a laptop before spending the money and be sure it looks and feels premium – this one certainly does.
In terms of hardware - for me, this machine has all the needed features of high-performance CPU, SSD, plenty of RAM, good storage space, and a very nice screen. There are also plenty of USB ports, with 1 Thunderbolt and HDMI. I must say having the Thunderbolt is nice as that is starting to be the way to go in the future to have one connection that rules them all. Quick comment that it was surprising at first not to have a network plug as that has almost always been pretty much standard on any laptop you look at. In the real world a hardwire connection is not needed that often, and have already gotten an inexpensive connector for Ethernet plug if the need should ever arise. Lack of a network plug has not been a problem – even when first setting up the machine it connected to home wireless system and was up and running without a hitch.

The hardware, styling, and performance are what I want and expect from an up-to-date gaming laptop, but having all of this at the price point set for the Best Buy model is what really makes the package nice. What I am saying I guess is that there are a good number of gaming laptops on the market, but this model hits all the sweet spots for me, has better specs than many, performs at a high level, and comes in with an attractive price for a well-built and well-styled machine.

I will be playing around with VR soon, and this unit passes the STEAM VR-Ready benchmarks with plenty of room to spare – no problem there. I have only had the laptop a short while, but with several current games set at high to ultra settings the laptop is able to provide a smooth, visual gaming experience. There will always be some games that need to be dropped down from the very highest settings to run at their best, but that is to be expected considering this laptop has the 1060 video chip. Just a technical note for you – if you are looking at the 1060 be sure you go with the 6gig of RAM and not the 3gig version on some of the mid-range machines. More RAM is really needed to get higher performance from the 1060 chipset. As always, you can spend more money to get a higher 1070 or 1080 video chipset, but this machine is about having a good price point and not about having the best of everything regardless of the price.

"So I bought this laptop as a secondary PC for when I travel and overall I think it is great for a mobile device. I would recommend it if you plan on operating near a power outlet often.

Pros:
CPU has plenty of power with 6 cores (12 threads) to get work done, in some situations even too much power (read cons below)

Keyboard feels nice to use. The buttons don't cause any strain to press and it has a full number pad on the right hand side. RGB lights are a bonus.

Pretty lightweight because it doesn't have a DVD drive, so be prepared to save things to a USB or use cloud storage.

The display goes up to 120Hz so that is nice if you are playing games that don't have frames per second limitations.

The sound from the speakers in this laptop actually sound pretty nice, laptop built in speakers usually don't sound that great. The Sonic Studio software has some great speaker options for tweaking the sound quality.

The 1TB hard drive is big enough to store all of my applications on the go and the 120GB SSD is fast for booting windows.

The GTX 1060 plays majority of games on high settings with no problem.

Cons:
I have noticed is that the CPU stays pretty hot even when the system is idle. The i7 8750H has a standard speed of 2.1GHz but it can turbo boost up to 4.1GHz. I found that my CPU was constantly in turbo boost mode which made it run a bit hotter than I wanted it to. I had to install an application to limit the CPU speed in order to keep it cool, afterwards it was fine.

Battery life isn't that great on this laptop. I could probably game at maximum capacity for about 1.5 hours before it dies. If you are just surfing the web or word processing you could probably get 3+ hours out of it, but I wouldn't expect too much more than that. I attribute the poor battery life to the turbo boosted CPU speed that I mentioned earlier, constantly running at 4.1GHz drains the battery quickly.

The built in camera is honestly garbage. Any $30 usb camera will give you better quality than this will. I could record better video with my cell phone if I wanted to. I have little to no intention of actually using it so it wasn't really a big deal for me.",Blackflame,Great Laptop,2,0,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5

Right out of the box, the machine feels really solid, it can withstand some amount of rought use. The weight is also very reasonal for 15.6 inch at 5.5 lbs. I am not a big fan of a gaming laptop as you need bigger screen and good amount of surround sound to really enjoy the games. I tested a couple of games, one of which was gears of war ultimate edition. I tested them in both laptop mode and connecting the laptoip to my home theater to display on tv. i enjoyed both modes although i liked the bigger sound and screen. The games came out great, no stutter, clear and smooth. i do not think you will need to spend more money to go higher end for gaming. The GPU is good enough for gaming and the advantage of gaming laptop vs putting money in Xbox or PS4 is the ability to do othet things like using it for work or other activies.

"The Asus GU501GM is the best laptop in its class and price range. The build quality in my opinion is great. It has a minimal gaming laptop look thats sleek and does not scream out GAMING laptop, lol. It has a brushed metal look with a ROG logo on top.The keyboard is quite nice and from what I've experienced there is no flex when typing or gaming. Keys have a nice travel distance when pressed and feels good.The keyboard is also backlit RGB, which you can customize to your liking. The keyboard is also surrounded by a nice bronzed metallic trim which looks classy. Speakers a quite adequate when gaming or watching movies, but if you're a serious gamer you'll probably own a good set of gaming headphones to play games. Press the power button and boot up is almost instant, just a couple of seconds. I like the dedicated ROG gaming center button which lets you access system information like CPU & GPU temperatures, hard drive space, memory usage etc. Spec wise the Asus GU501GM has a full HD 1920x1080 15.6 inch screen that is 120mhz. Includes a 1T HDD and 128GB SSD. It also comes with 16GB of Ram that you can upgrade to 32GB. It has an 8th generation Inte Core I7-8750H processor and a NVIDIA GeForce 1060 graphics card that is 6GB. You have 4 3.0 USB ports, HDMI port, headphone and 1 thunderbolt port. I've been playing Fortnite and PUBG most recently on this laptop on the highest settings without any issues, it plays buttery smooth! I've also played GoW and that play great on high settings also without a problem. I think with this new laptop I will definitely be doing more gaming. I also forgot to mention Asus also include a nice keychain lanyard in the box with some stickers. Overall this laptop is a good value for the price with the specs it comes with that I would recommend for anyone looking for their next gaming laptop.",Parker,Best Gaming Laptop in its Class/Price Range!,2,0,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",5
"As a College Student in an Information Technology Bachelor’s Degree program¬—and the unfortunate fact that the hard drive on my MacBook Pro failed for the second time—I decided that I would purchase a high-end PC Laptop to run the PC programs required for my classes, directly on the Desktop locally instead of having to run them inside of Guest Operating System installed inside of a Virtual Machine. The bonus to purchasing such a laptop would also be my entrance into PC Gaming as a whole, on top of currently owning a Sony PS4 500 GB, Nintendo Switch, and “New” Nintendo 3DS XL – Hyrule Edition as dedicated gaming consoles.
At first glance, the MSI GS63 Stealth-10 is a beautiful piece and a work of art that doesn’t immediately scream Gaming PC when it is closed, holding true to its name. The aluminum case is black and appears like it has been carefully sandblasted to create the vertical wood grain appearance that sets the tone for its sophisticated appearance comparable to a luxury car. It is incredibly lightweight—4.39Lbs—compared to its competitors and even lighter than my MacBook Pro! The main air vents are on the left and right sides, the back and on the bottom adjacent to the vents in the back, with a few more areas for air to flow in to keep it cool. There’s even six evenly spaced feet on the bottom that keeps the entire laptop slightly raised when it is sitting on a table or flat surface.

The display is not a touch screen, but it is 15.6 inches and outputs to Full HD Widescreen LED in 1080p (1920 x 1080).
The Storage is 256GB Solid State Drive (C:\) and 1TB Hard Disk Drive (D:\), which should be plenty of storage for all your PC games and programs in the long run.
The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 included in this laptop will certainly handle any game you choose to throw at it, and there are even some games that are specifically supported by it—one of which I’m going to include in this review.
16GB RAM will be enough to run most games at their highest settings, except for far more demanding titles like Final Fantasy XV that recommends 16GB RAM, even though it needs a bare minimum of 8GB RAM just to run. Should you choose that you want to get the most out of such a hefty title, the RAM is upgradable up to 32GB.
This laptop holds nothing back with the Intel 8th Generation Core i7-8750H does have a base speed of 2.2 GHz, but it makes even a deep antivirus scan of every single file in the computer take about an average of five minutes. Webpages load within a second, and there is literally no input lag while typing documents over OneCloud during everyday use of the laptop.
There is one USB 2.0 Type A and 3 USB 3.0 Type A Ports, one HDMI Outlet, one Thunderbolt 3 Port, one Ethernet Port, built-in webcam, HiFi Headphone jack, microphone jack, and Kingston Lock, and Card Reader.
The Audio Technology is Dynaudio Premium Sound Technology, ESS SABRE HiFi audio DAC technology; which provides excellent spatial sound separation even without headphones on.

The GS63 Stealth-10 comes preinstalled with all the additional software you could ever think of needing for gaming on a laptop, including: Dragon Center, SteelSeries Engine 3, Nahimic 3, and GeForce Experience. I will be going a little more in detail on these four programs below, along with my impressions of the software.

Dragon Center is MSI’s all-in-one dashboard that includes System Monitoring, System Tuner, Gaming Mode, Voice Wizard, Mobile Center, and Tools & Help. 
System Monitoring monitors the percent use of CPU, GPU, Memory, and the Disk in real time along with the current Device Information and Loading Status. System Monitoring also has the options Free Up Memory and Clean Up Disk. Device Information lists the CPU and GPU by name, the amount of RAM, the SSD and HDD space that is occupied and available for use. Loading Status includes the current Power Plan, Ethernet Speed, Wi-Fi Speed, and the rotation speeds for both fans.
System Tuner allows the user to change the setting based on already configures presets that determine such things as the DPI, Shift, Fan Speed, and the MSI’s RGB display setting. System Tuner comes with six different modes to readily choose from called: Current, Performance, Theater, Meeting, Profile 01, Profile 02. Each of these modes have their own setup that can be changed at any time with their own changeable settings that are uniform across all the six modes. I will just be going over the settings in the Current mode for this very reason. Inside of Current, there is a switch to turn the Windows Key on and off, a switch to swap the effects of the Windows Key and the Function Key, a VR Ready Switch, and the earlier mentioned presets. The DPI option can be changed in 25% intervals from 100% to 200%, (i.e. 100%, 125%, 150%, etc.) The Shift option contains the presets Turbo, Sport, Comfort, and ECO along with power options to manually change the power options on the laptop. Fan Speed can be changed from Auto to Basic, Advanced, or Cooler Boost. The MSI’s RGB has the following options: Standard, Anti-Blue, Gaming, Movie, Office, and Light.
For games that are supported by it, Gaming Mode can optimize system performance and provide auto-tuning function for the game you are playing.
Compatible with TeamSpeak, Raidcall, Skype, SkypeHost, Discord and Steam Client Bootstrapper; Voice Wizard uses VoiceBoost, which Dragon Center describes as an audio mixer than manages the VOIP and game volume proportion that also automatically adjusts.
Mobile Center allows you to connect to the Dragon Center remotely with the MSI App.
Tools & Help includes Burn Recovery for creating a recovery image, User Manual, Help Desk, Product Registration, Battery Calibration, and Feature Navigator.

SteelSeries Engine 3 is a program that allows you to manage, synchronize, and configure any devices that are compatible with the engine, offers a suite of applications that you can configure to interact with your SteelSeries devices, and even allows you to configure custom device configurations for any game that you add to the Engine’s Library—even software you downloaded from Steam. The RGB Keyboard on the laptop is completely customizable in this engine, and comes preinstalled with the following configurations: Aqua, Chakra, Default, Disable, Disco, Drain, Free Way, and Plain. If you’re feeling creative, you can also create your own customizable preset, which will be added to the list of the already existing presets, and all presets can be deleted, renamed, and saved and infinite amount of times. I personally had a lot of fun just experimenting with the presets and customizing my own, especially making color schemes based on a few of my favorite games. This is a very powerful tool to really personalize the laptop and really make it your own.

Nahimic 3 is a powerful tool that you can use to optimize the audio coming out of your headphones and going into the microphone, while also providing a Sound Tracker that you can use to track the audio relative to your position in-game.
The Audio Effects each include the following effects that you can turn on and off to your personal preference: Surround Sound, Volume Stabilizer, Voices, Bass, and Tremble. Audio Effects are divided into four categories that share the same effect options: Music, Movie, Communication, and Gaming. In each of these categories—in addition to turning the effects on and off—you can readily adjust the DB on Voices, Bass, and Tremble to get the most optimal sound quality from your speakers or headset.
The Microphone Effects are divided into two categories named Chat, and Conference; both of which have the same following options that can be turned on and off: Static Noise Suppression, Echo Cancellation, Lateral Sound Cancellation, and Microphone Boost. Static Noise Suppression is the only one of these options that can be adjusted, based on how quiet or how noisy your current environment is at the time—especially cutting out the noise coming from the fans.

GeForce Experience gives you access to adjusting the framerate on games, updating the latest driver for the GTX 1060, and the settings that you would want to use for any voice chat or streaming. It even gives you the ability to open the in-game overlay to record video or even to broadcast live without having to open a separate window.

I will be concluding this rather lengthy review with my impressions on how well the laptop runs and renders Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, which is also one of the games that is fully compatible and recognizable by GeForce Experience. Upon playing several hours of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, I have found the GTX 1060 really helps to bring out the crisp details even at a far distance at very high settings as well as particle effects such as leaves almost having the appearance that they could just fly out of the screen. I experienced absolutely no lag at all. Additionally, the Surround Sound audio was extraordinary, and I could hear the voices of the disembodied characters from my left, right, and even every angle behind me. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this laptop, and I would highly recommend it to anyone on the fence of getting a Gaming Laptop. I can certainly guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",Chris,Excellent Gaming Laptop,17,2,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"I am in college double majoring in Computer Science and Multi Software development. My major requires me to have a laptop with a minimum of 16GB of ram and at minimum, a GTX 1050. This laptop meets this requirement most definitely and functions very well.

To begin, this laptop has a nice design to it. It does not spell at ""gamer"" rather than looking more on the luxuries side, and that is what I personally like. Plus the laptop is quit thin and only weighs around 4 lbs.

This laptop is equipped with a GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5, 16 GB of DDR4 memory @2400Mhz, an 8th generation Intel i7-8750H, 256 M.2 SSD Storage, and an 1TB SATA HDD at 5200 RPM. This laptop, with the new next gen. Intel processors, is powerful enough to handle just about any games and intense programs at ultra settings 1080p @60Hz (yes the screen is only 60 Hz).

As far as ports go, the laptop has a decent selection of ports. There are images displayed above for the product showing the ports. No USB-C though, but it does have three USB-3.1 Ports and one USB-2.0 port. It also has a thunderbolt 3 port.

Setup:

The setup process wasn't all that bad to me personally like it has been for other laptops I've used in the past. When you first startup the laptop and set it up, the CPU will be (or at least was for me) quite high. To begin, you should want to remove all or mostly all bloatware from the laptop (especially Norton Security, as this will drive your CPU to max at times. Unless you personally use it or want to use it, keep it. Otherwise, remove it). I recommend not removing any MSI, Intel, or Rival gear software, as those software work independently with the laptop. Once you do this, make sure to update most programs on the laptop, including software such as MSI and Intel. After that update the graphics card drivers in the Geforce Experience application. Then restart the computer and update Windows. This can be a pain since there has been so many updates released over the past months for Windows 10, so make sure to do download and install them all. The issue is it will try installing them all at once which it cannot do since some need to be installed before others. To ensure no issues, troubleshoot the Windows Update software in the settings. If it detects issues, make sure they are resolved and restart the computer. Then continue updates. When you're all done, you should have the new Windows Feature update, released back in April I do believe.

After all this the computer should be functioning normally and be much faster.

The battery modes (using MSI Dragon Center) and Battery Life:

The laptop has different battery modes that are all handled by MSI through the Dragon Center application. The dragon center application allows you to check the temperatures of your GPU and CPU, free ram, and free disk space. It also allows you to change the battery modes of course and many other things. Speaking of the battery modes, there are a few. Those include Turbo (which is mostly used for gaming), Sport, Comfortable, ECO, and Power Settings. ECO is mostly used when you're not gaming and the AC power adapter is unplugged. This will ensure your battery life is more efficient and has long legibility. Power Settings mode makes it so MSI uses the default settings in Windows in the power management section (aka. Balanced Mode, High Performance, etc). When the AC power adapter is plugged in, you have access to all the modes. When unplugged, you only have access to ECO and Power Settings. Because of this the performance of the laptop during heavy applications and games, when only running on battery power, is jeopardized compared to when running the laptop with the AC power adapter plugged in.

As far as battery life goes, when running on ECO mode and not gaming but maybe doing some light tasks (such as web browsing, YouTube videos, word, and etc), I was able to get close to around 4 hours of battery life, which is pretty decent for a gaming laptop.

When gaming on the laptop on battery power, I was only able to get close to an hour of battery life.

The charger for this laptop does not use USB-C unfortunately, however, it does have a 90 degree turn capability to it, so you can situate it in an different position depending on where you're sitting.

Temperatures:

The only caveat about this laptop really is the temperatures. When idling, the temperatures of the CPU hover around 30 - 40 degrees Celsius. This is not all that bad, however, when running intense applications or games, the temperatures of the CPU can hit an astonishing 80 - 98+ degrees Celsius. Do keep in mind that the max limit the CPU can take is 100 degrees Celsius and this laptop reaches those temperatures at only around 30/40 percent usage on the CPU. So don't count on doing anything more intensive involving the CPU.

The GPU isn't any different either. When the GPU hits around 98/99 percent usage (which it should on all games and heavy programs involving it), it hits an astonishing 91/92 degrees Celsius. The max temperature an GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5 can take before shutting down via downclocking due to temperature throttling is 93 degrees Celsius. This is right on the edge of that.

And do keep in mind that I had reached these temperatures in only a few minutes of using a heavy application. Afterwards, they didn't seem to change. I also had the laptop on a flat surface with enough airflow.

Other than the temperatures, the laptop is solid. Even though the temperatures are high, as long as you don't overdo it, the laptop shouldn't have any temperature throttling and applications will utilize the laptops hardware fully.

The laptop also has padding on the bottom of the chassis to keep your lap from burning when having the laptop on your lap. The keyboard and palm rest area does not get that hot either, so the laptop is comfortable to use when gaming or doing intense work.

Keyboard and Trackpad:

The keyboard on this laptop is really solid. It has good key travel and you should be able to get used to the laptops keyboard rather quickly and type decently fast with it. The keyboard's lighting was designed by Steel Series, so it has really good RGB lights and the keyboard's lighting can be customized via the Steel Series application on Windows. I personally have a Steel Series gaming mouse and I think the Steel Series application is one of the best in managing your peripheral hardware, by Steel Series of course.

The keyboard also has custom function keys to manage the lighting profiles of the keyboard, as well as edit things such as the screen brightness, the keyboard brightness, the system sounds, and so forth.

There is also a macro key assigned to F4 on the keyboard. To use it, hold down Fn + F4 to set what the key does. Then when you hit Fn + F4, it will launch an specific application you set.

The trackpad uses windows precision drivers, however, the surface of the trackpad is plastic. Therefore, the trackpad isn't all that solid. It is kind of hard to get used to and doesn't work all that well sensitivity wise due to its surface material. You can of course edit the settings of the trackpad in windows, but it will take a lot of tweaking until you can get it just right.

Audio:

The speakers on the laptop are not that terrible. They are rather decent. The issue is that they are facing downward on the bottom of the laptop making them more unclear and washed out. Also there is no bass what so ever, so don't expect to listen to music all that often using the speakers of the laptop. The headphone jack is decent of course though.

Summary:

This laptop is a really good choice if you're looking for a gaming laptop that can do both gaming and work. The laptop is packed with decent features and 2018 hardware. The keyboard is fairly good, but the trackpad's surface could use a slight touch-up. The battery is great for a gaming laptop and the battery software ensures good battery life but also a great gaming performance. The speakers aren't all that bad, but would rather function better being placed on top of the chassis rather than the bottom. Temperatures are by far the worst part of this laptop, however, when reapplying thermal paste and positioning the laptop differently, you can sufficiently lower temperatures but not by a huge margin. The setup for the laptop took some time but afterwards, the performance of the laptop has been up to expectations. The overall design of the laptop is very well done and the laptop has a good selection of ports. Needless to say, this is a great laptop for the value of your money and I could not say enough that I do personally recommend this laptop to you.",Gonfonix,"An Excellent, Efficient Gaming Laptop",7,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"I will soon be venturing off to college, and because of our society's current technological requirements, I would be needing a laptop. As someone who also likes to dabble in PC gaming, I wanted a laptop that would be able to run all the current games respectably.

Therefore, my perfect laptop would consist of these characteristics:
 - Thin and light: I want a laptop that is easy to carry around from class to class.
 - Powerful: I was looking at laptops with at least a GTX 1060.
 - Great Battery Life: Since the laptop would be used in class, I desired 5+ hours of battery life to make it through a typical day of classes.
 - Subtle Design: I did not want a laptop that broadcasted to the entire campus that my laptop was a gaming laptop.

After a significant amount of time researching different laptops, I settled on the MSI GS63 Stealth-010. 

Packaging: The laptop is packaged in very secure and impressive packaging. I would not be afraid of having it shipped to my house.

Size: This laptop is thin. Really thin. For perspective, the laptop itself is thinner than the diameter of a dime; if you set the laptop and a dime on a level table, the laptop is a shade thicker because it has rubber pads that elevate it off of the surface. It is also very light. It fits well in my standard backpack and it does not feel noticeably heavier than the school-issued Chromebook I carried around this past school year. The power brick on the cord is also smaller than I expected for a gaming laptop (6 x 2 7/8 x 7/8 inches). It fits nicely for transportation. 

Set-Up: The set-up process was actually relatively frustrating for me and my dad, but the issues were not related to the laptop at all. Other reviews complain of bloatware, but what they really are complaining about is the default Windows 10 applications. Those are stupid to say the least. However, the laptop itself only has a couple default apps and they are all useful. There is the Dragon Center, which allows you to montior your system and is the performance center. There is the SteelSeries Engine app for the keyboard. And there is a photo and video editing software that is not a trial, but a full version and seems serviceable (PhotoDirector and PowerDirector). The set-up issues primarily came from the Windows Update 1803. YouTube videos would not play. After hours of research and restoring backups, I simply downloaded the latest Intel Internal Graphics Card Drivers and everything was working perfectly. After that, set-up was a success. 

Keyboard and Audio: The audio is not horrible, better than what I was expecting. Don't anticipate booming bass. However, the keyboard is a dream. The keyboard itself is easy to type on and is very responsive. After typing on it for a couple of days, I find it hard to switch to regular keyboard. In addition, there is infinite possibility with the SteelSeries Engine for programming the RGB backlights. The UI for the app is simple and easy to learn, within 5 or 10 minutes I was able to program an American Flag configuration that appears to be majestically billowing in the wind. My keyboard is a bit squeaky, I do not know if this is a common problem but it does not bother me. 

Outward Appearace: I'm happy that MSI did not decorate this laptop with the cliche gaming laptop bright colors and extravagant designs on the outside of the laptop. It is a simply bushed metal look; the only sign that the laptop is a gaming laptop is the MSI Dragon logo on the top, which is tastefully subtle. There is also a nice felt covering on the bottom of the laptop which is nice for carrying and also when using on your lap. 

Ports: For being such a thin laptop, MSI was able to squeeze everything you would need. The battery cable also has a 90 degree bend so it does not get in the way. 

Trackpad: Others have complained about the trackpad. I think it is pretty good. The one issue is that you have to put some pressure to get a click to register, but I use a Bluetooth mouse anyhow (and the connectivity is great.)

Battery: This was one of the most important characteristics to me, and the Stealth checks every box. This laptop can get a consistent 6+ hours of battery life when doing light work (such as writing this review), watching videos, etc. When I'm not gaming, I set the laptop to the best battery settings which is quite simple to do. First, I set the laptop to Windows Battery Saver, which is one click in the toolbar. Then, I turn off the backlighting on the keyboard, which is for me FN + 0, then I set the laptop to ECO mode through dragon center, which is FN + F5. All in all, 10 seconds to let your laptop get plenty of battery life. And when gaming, just plug the laptop in. No one should expect any great battery life when gaming. 

Gaming: This laptop can really do it all. It has a 6GB GTX 1060 and 16 GB RAM. Most importantly, this is a full 1060 and not a MAX-Q variant. The full 1060 is able to perform a little worse if not as good or a little better than a MAX-Q variant of the 1070 in a lot of thin gaming laptops. I have no worries when I download a new game. For example, I can get solid 60 FPS on Destiny 2 with max settings and 100+ FPS on Overwatch's max settings. 

Storage Space: The 256 GB SSD leaves something to be desired, but there is no issue in using the HDD to save and launch applications, so I do not have a problem.

The screen: The one negative point of this laptop. The screen is only a 60 HZ refresh rate. It personally doesn't bother me, especially because this laptop is incredible in all other aspects. 

Overall, this laptop checks every box that I had for a classwork computer and a gaming computer for a comparatively low price. Anyone who is searching for a laptop with the same expectations as I have without having to spend $2000+ on the only competitor in the Razer Blade should get this laptop.",Kevin,The Laptop That Can Do It All,5,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"I was a few days out from a trip across the country when my 2012 Macbook finally kicked the can. So i started researching and finding things in my price range, with quality specs and upgradability. I was surprised that Best Buy had some nice MSI and ASUS laptops on the show floor. After a day or two of more research, i settled on this MSI GS63 STEALTH 010. Big Screen, thin design, plenty of CPU power, upgradeable RAM, and a GTX 1060 with 6GB of DRAM. This was quite a jump from what i was used to. Plus no waiting for shipping, and Best Buy's helpful techs got me in and out with my new laptop in no time.

Now i do not really game a ton on PC's, so i was skeptical of looking at gaming laptops. I do a lot of 3D modeling and design for 3D Printing, and other hobby projects. More work station aimed laptops seemed bland, big, or just out of my price range for the tasks i required. Don't have use for a 2:1 either. But this MSI impressed me with affordability and nice specs. Comparing it to newer ASUS gaming models, i didn't need a GTX 1070 or 1080 really, so why spend another $500 for something i won't fully utilize? And so far using it, it powers through things like Fusion 360, Simplify3d, Inventor, Sketchup. I'm quite pleased. Especially since Windows literally boots in >5 seconds, compared to my 5 min wait for OSX...It's nice stepping into the current realm of computing power! Lots of great I/O, and it has a LAN PORT! For crying out loud i don't want 1800 dongles just to use my laptop. This thing's got HDMI ,Thunderbolt 3, Mini Display Port, 3 USB 3.0, SD card reader (great for transferring files to my 3D printer!) 

Now i must talk of some of the things i wasn't too impressed with. First off, i like illuminated keyboards, but the darn stock program was this RGB rainbow of a circus that i had to immediately turn to a solid red. This was after multiple updates to the keyboard control software until it took. Minimal problem, but i don't need the bells and whistles. Also the thing is a fingerprint MAGNET! It looks great with with brushed metal like finish, but 2 mins into having it i could see all the finger prints, palm marks, and dust all over it. I'm considering getting a skin or hard shell case for it. There's a average amount of bloatware, and recently after a MSI update installed, i can here my fans rev up quite a lot, with task manager not really showing anything unusual happening. That's another thing, it plays Fortnite and Minecraft like I've never played it before, but man, the fans get LOUD. Speakers are decent for background music play but can get tinny, so i will definitely use headphones for gaming and movie watching. Keyboard feels good, although the chassis above it where the speakers are is quite flexible.

Overall 4/5 stars. Affordable, powerful, not bad on the eyes, and has some expand-ability in it's future. I would recommend for those casual gamers, hobbyists looking to step up from an older machine, students who need something to do school work while having some power to game on the side.",Adam,Great Looks and Quality Specs makes ideal upgrade,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",4
"That's right, I'm not a gamer, so if that is your interest, I can't tell you much. I bought this computer hoping to be able to run CAD software reasonably well without spending thousands more for a workstation grade laptop. I haven't had enough time to evaluate all of the software that I will be using (Solidworks, Inventor, etc.) so all I can comment on at this point are my general impressions of the computer. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with it so far. I don't like spending money on electronics, and I hate spending money on electronics and then have to deal with a lot of problems, fixing things that ought to just work, so I was a little unsure of buying a computer with a dragon on it :} But I've been impressed. Considering the high performance hardware packed into this thing, it is quite slim and sleek, and won't look too out of place in a business meeting. The quality feels pretty good, especially opening and closing the lid. The keyboard is ridiculous and the first thing I did was to turn the lights off (ok, first I had to try ""disco"" mode), but later I changed it to a simple single color except for the f, j, down arrow and 5 keys to help me position my hands in low light. The light color varies significantly from key to key when assigned the same color, poor uniformity of the LEDs I suppose, but it isn't horrible. Performance on office productivity apps is very good, unsurprisingly. The only CAD I've installed so far is Fusion 360, and it will smoothly rotate their sample Formula SAE car model like an ADHD kid with a fidget spinner. Unless I run into some hardware incompatibilities because I don't have a 'certified' quadro card, I think this PC will perform quite well with large assemblies and even moderate FEA simulations.

There isn't too much bloatware, other than all the gaming 'enhancements', and those haven't gotten in my way yet so I've left most of them installed. Other than that there are some simple games like candy crush and some preloaded Norton utilities, but that has been easy enough to uninstall (freed up several BG on the SSD) and I haven't been bothered with a lot of popups. The only snag so far has been after a windows update, I couldn't play videos. I manually updated the drivers for the on-board video chip and the Nvidia and it has been fine since. Oh, and it would go to sleep automatically when plugged in even though the power option was set to ""never"". Had to enable ""show hibernation in power menu"" option and now it works properly. Occasionally my bluetooth headset says it is connected but I don't get sound through it. As soon as I open the bluetooth control panel I get sound. Bur really, overall, living with this computer has been pretty trouble free.

Some other misc. observations:
-The keys on the number keypad are a little narrow so can be a little tricky. But at least it has a dedicated number keypad.
-The trackpad makes a noise whenever I tap it. I don't use trackpads much, but I don't think this is typical. It sounds a little loose.
-It is supposed to support two external monitors. I haven't tried this yet, maybe it is possible through the thunderbolt port or maybe it will require one monitor on an HDMI cable and one on a display port cable. The MSI manual online is no help at all.
-Plenty of usb ports and a thunderbolt port should make it easy to connect other devices. 
-It isn't very loud compared to the Dell workstation I had at my last job. You do hear the fans but it doesn't sound like a jet.

"This device feels solid, from the moment you pull it out of the packaging to the moment you open it.
It has an awesome 6 core processer, that is plenty fast, and handles multi-tasking like a champ.
It runs DDR 4 @ 2400, which can not only be upgraded to 32 Gigabytes, but you can get the upgraded memory clock speeds too. I have had this device for over a day now and I love it. 
I love the feel of the keyboard, its quiet and feels comfortable. The keys feel smooth and my hands feel relaxed after extended use. 
I personally am not a big fan of the track pad, It's not awful, but playing games or doing things that require a right click or fast paced movement, this can slow you down, and makes things awkward. For portability it is acceptable, useable and adjustable via configuration settings, I will most likely use a USB / BT mouse.
Thunderbolt 3 IS great, it allows me to keep this device and upgrade the GPU with an EGPU option ensuring I get longevity, and a possible DTR (Desktop Replacement) that will allow me to update the graphics card as time goes on, and allowing me to be portable with a decent dedicated graphics card when needed. 
Thankfully MSI kept the SD Card slot on the side, which is nice, as many devices still use SD/MICRO options.
I love that there is still an Ethernet port on this bad boy, allowing me to play at LAN parties if need be. 
Wifi works ok, I feel like it might conk out a few times, however I don't feel like this is a fault on MSI as much, feels like this is more of a driver issue, potentially a Windows issue. 
Keyboard RGB color combinations / modifications, are way cool. However I am not somebody who will take advantage of the cool features, one thing I did love and want to note is that the default FN button highlights the selectable control keys red. Such as volume up, down etc.. This is awesome because sometimes they can be pretty easy to lose sight of, this is a nice default, makes finding key binds easy. 

Gaming on this device is pretty sweet. Normally I have not been a fan of the Optimus (Intel / Nvidia ) due to a lack of gsync, yet it still handles games pretty easily. Screen is only 60hz, not a big issue for the price point.. I feel games look great and vibrant, 
and battery life is ok when you don't game. I am looking to see if there is an external battery pack that can power this device while I am on the go, and perhaps might purchase a secondary battery for long trips. For me battery life isn't too big a deal, as this 
device will mostly stay plugged in. 

The weight on this thing is amazingly light. Even the power brick is on the smaller side. I personally travel a lot, and love that this is so thin, so light and feels sturdy. 
I love the flexibility of the screen, I was able to the point the laptop looked like a giant tablet. Would I suggest this, or use this? Probably not, but it is still pretty neat.

I've read a lot of reviews about people saying the device gets loud. I personally don't think it is loud. I had a Predator 17 X with a 1080 Graphics card, thing weighed 20 Lbs, it got hot and loud, sounded more like a jet ready for take off. This device when under full load can get noisy, but it isn't as exaggerated as every one makes it out to be. As I write this review in a Barnes and Noble Starbucks, this device makes no noise under normal use. I played Metamorph on high settings, device fan's didn't kick in. I went into the configuration settings and set it on Cooler Boost. In a public place, This might be considered loud, but you can change these settings, and adjust the fans as needed. Not a big deal

Overall, this is an amazing, lightweight device. Not only can it handle games well, provide futureproofing specs, but can also be carried in a backpack or in your hand and hardly feel it, when compared to other laptops. Is it worth the price? Yeah, without a doubt. I sold my Gaming Acer Predator 17 X with a 1080 Graphics card, for a more portable option for gaming and work.

"I was looking for a gaming laptop that I could use as an actual travel/work/leisure laptop that could do both work and gaming and this truly exceeded my expectations. The case is a beautiful, aluminum and thin and light compared to the clearly cheaper Omen and bulky and still plastic Alienware equivalents. It is new enough to Best Buy that it wasn't on the shelves in the config I got, which has the 8th Gen I7-8750H and upgraded nVidia geforce 1060 with 6gb rather than the budget 3gb version. Between the new processor and the vidio card, I've been running games like Overwatch and PUBG on high with a standard 60fps and no lag. 

When it's running a game it does have a noticeable fan noise, but, honestly, when compared to my Alienware R4 running a 1070, it's practically silent in comparison. 

The built in Steelseries RGB keyboard is absolutely beautiful and fully customizable and squeezing in the number pad is always a plus for me in a 15.4 form factor. 

The screen is standard 1080p., which is fine for the size, but you can project on a 4k monitor for better rez, but it does affect framerate if you want to play above low settings.

For everyday use the most amazing aspect is the battery life. I left the power cord at home one day, and just had the computer. Even with the keyboard in 'disco mode' lighting which got a few laughs from colleagues, and a couple of breaks gaming, the battery lasted a 9 hour day no problems. 

If I were to have a bit of gripe, it would be the touchpad. You do have to play with the settings a bit to get it to emulate all of the standard functions of a Synaptics touchpad in Windows 10. It still doesn't quite do what I expect on occasion, but more tinkering should fix that, particularly with sensitivity.

You'll likely want to upgrade the SSD's in the system and it takes one M.2. and one 3.5 form factor hard drive, so it is upgradeable there. It comes with a standard 16gb installed, but I believe you can upgrade to 32gb. 

No optical drive, no touch screen, but 3 USB 3 ports, one USB 2.0 and a thunderbolt/usb-c port. The camera is not Windows Hello for login for those who have an Alienware, and the speakers aren't super great, but fine. An HDMI and minidisplayport are available for multiple monitors. 

Also, the base of the computer has a felt surface, which makes a difference for when using as a lap laptop. I did notice that there was some heat up in the upper right side during use, but not scorching like an HP Spectre, which I have two of. 

Overall, for the size, the processor, the video card and performance I would say get them while you can. This is a great upgrade from the previous version and is better for battery life and performance than any of the other 15.4 screen gaming configs available in store in Best Buy.",ArtOfRock,Great Compact Gaming Laptop,19,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5

The last time I bought a laptop that could game it was a big disappointment. This 15.6-inch MSI GS63 Stealth Thin-010 gaming laptop has completely changed the way I look at gaming laptops. This competes with the best the industry has to offer in its price range. Its thin and light, looks great and even with long gaming sessions the fan doesn’t get to loud and even better it keeps the temps under control. The new six core Intel processor is a beast. It really is a big step up from the previous generation and its about time Intel put out a product like this. Prior i7 processors were a little bit better each time but not by much. The eighth generation processors really are a nice performance boost. Add a true 6GB Nvidia GTX 1060 and 1080p gaming is like butter. I have connected it to my 34” widescreen 2k G-Sync monitor and it pushes it just fine. I do have to turn down some of the game setting from my desktop computer but that would be true for any GTX 1060. Oh and G-Sync was working just fine on the display port connector. You might need to get an adapter since the laptop only has a mini displayport connector. But that's a small trade off for how thin this laptop is. It has a great RGB Steelseries keyboard. It is fun to have the lights going and there are many setting options including turning them off if you want. I like how if you hit the FN key only the keys that are tied to that function key light up. It makes finding the keys to change the screen brightness or volume easy to find. One problem I always have with laptops is the trackpad. I do like the one here. It maynot be the best but it feels and works just fine. I would still game with a mouse but it never got in the way. There is much to like here but there is room for improvement. One thing I do not understand is why MSI elected to use a SSD drive in the M.2 connector. The difference in the speed of the M.2 drives over SSD drives is three to four times faster. And in this laptop it is quite difficult to change. Now that I have many hours on it I don’t find it to be a problem but it just seems silly to have the faster connection and not use it. Once the warranty is over I might think about changing it but it is a minor annoyance. The screen is bright and colorful. There are better screens to be found but the price goes up. Still I like the screen and really don’t have any complaints. I would have liked it to be a G-Sync screen with a higher refresh rate but it is a nice screen and the GTX 1060 is a good match for it. I have not had many MSI products but this feels very solid and there is almost no flex. Also they have put a felt pad on the bottom. This was a good decision because you can surf with in on your lap and it doesn’t get hot. That’s partly due to the felt padding and also this laptop uses the Intel integrated graphics on the CPU when you not playing a game in full screen. Very cool and that means I am getting in excess of 4 or 5 hours of battery when I am doing other things besides gaming. To game you will always want to be connected to an outlet so it can run at full speed as much as possible. I am very satisfied with almost everything about this laptop. Now if I could just get my employer to see the light and buy this for work and trash out the business laptops we are issued. With this processor and graphics on hand it can make those travel days just a bit better and the actual work I do faster.

"I and my brother were looking for a gaming laptop which we could use for school/leisure. We actually did little research about PC builds before making this MSI GS63 Stealth-010 purchase in-store at Best Buy. I would give many plus points for this laptop due to its user interface setup. With the Steelseries Engine 3, you can easily assess to your keyboard and handle its backlights as much as you wish. I was super impressed with the entire build in SteelSeries Engine app (Configurations Windows). You can create your own space in this device by customizing various functions in the Configurations Windows manually. My keyboard was overly satisfactory and responsive; easy to type on it for long hours. This laptop has a different range of battery modes. You can change the battery modes through the Dragon Center app. I set mine to ECO mode when not running games (when running on ECO mode, battery life stays longer). The display is not a touchscreen (better battery saver) and it is 15.6"" Full Widescreen LED (1920 x 1080 resolution). The cooler boost works properly when switching between apps or running a game like Overwatch. I do expect a gaming laptop with less fan noise, however, it doesn't bother me much when operating heavy systems and apps. The storage is upgradeable 256GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive which is plenty of space for your PC apps and games. NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 is one of the best features for most gaming PCs. The NVIDIA Geforce experience did an excellent job over my expectations. I have no issue when playing my video games for multiple hours.

"I recently started a new job flying for the airlines and started looking for a laptop that I could take with me on my travels. I have been incredibly impressed with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone.

Pros:
-One of my favorite parts of this computer is the amazing performance I get with such a slim design. This laptop is thinner than any other gaming laptop I looked at, but still runs everything I run on it on Ultra settings at 60 fps. In addition to the thin profile it does not weigh very much and I dont mind hauling it all over the country. 
-The battery life is great (when not playing games). I am still in school and have used this laptop extensively for school work. I consistently get 6+ hours of continuous use on a single charge while browsing the web, writing papers and listening to music. 
-When I am not gaming the fans are super quiet. I cant hear them at all.
-Cooling is pretty good. For general use I am averaging about 40-45 degrees on the CPU/GPU. When I game the fans do make a lot more noise, but with headphones in I cant hear them at all. When I game I usually prop the back of the laptop up to increase airflow and I have never seen my temps go above 75.
-I like the feel of the keyboard. It has been great for typing long papers and has a good feel to it when typing. The back lighting is pretty cool as well and is completely customizable. 
-I love how many ports this computer has. I never need to worry about not having enough usb ports for my accessories.
-The computer looks super good. It is sleek clean and looks professional. I love the black aluminum finish on it. nice and sturdy construction all with staying nice and light. 

Cons:
-I dont like the track pad on this laptop. The click is pretty stiff and annoying to use. While you can change the tap functions (one vs two/ three finger tap) it took some digging to find how to do it. Once I got it though the pad is a lot better. I still mostly use a wireless mouse instead. Something that is also pretty annoying is the pad is super sensitive and when you type the courser will jump all over and move where you type even if you barely brush the pad with your palm. It is easiest to just lock the track pad with function +f3. 
-The computer comes with a ton of junk installed on it. There are a ton of little useless programs that come installed. I recommend cleaning up your system right when you get it. 
-The battery goes fast when gaming. If you arent plugged in when you start a game the battery goes pretty fast. you have about 40 minutes until your system starts to get throttled and settings and frames drop. At lower settings you can maybe get an hour and a half total use. Bottom line, if you are playing a game, plug it in. (This really isnt that big of a deal because the battery life is so good when not playing, and I dont really play when I dont have access to a plug anyway.

In conclusion this is an amazing laptop. The longer I have it the more I like it. I keep fine tuning the settings and get a better and better experience.

"I'll start with a list of the laptops features:

Display
-The display is pretty good. I like the resolution and brightness, but I have noticed some screen tearing while gaming(which is not unusual when you pair good gpus with 60hz displays). It only happens rarely with the games I play so it doesn't bother me that much but it might be annoying for fps players. I will be looking into ways to mitigate this as I am sure that they exist.

Storage
-The SSD gives this laptop a really fast boot up time, less than 10 secs (never counted exactly). Compared to my old laptop which took almost 2 minutes to boot, I find this pretty amazing. Plus this thing beats most other thin and light gaming laptops in terms of total storage. 256 gb of SSD is more than enough to keep your PC fast so the extra TB of HDD just sweetens the deal that much more if you like having a lot of storage.

Heat and Noise
-Performance with this laptop has been pretty good so far. I bought a cooling pad to rest this on and i'm not sure if it made that much of a difference , but I have not notice the laptop getting excessively hot while gaming. It also may be that my games are not that intensive so this may vary by user. The fans do however get quite noisy while gaming. There is software already installed that you can use to tweak the fan noise and make it less annoying (or you can review the laptop for a free set of headphones *wink wink*).

Battery Life
- The battery life is pretty good on this thing. I have not been able to get consistent or accurate readings from the battery predictor after 3 days of usage (some recent estimates were 2:47 at 93% or 9:31 at 77%) but by my own observation I would say that at 60% brightness you could squeeze out 4-6.5 hours (note-taking, some video streaming, some programming, keyboard light off). I am still trying to find ways to optimize the battery life and suspect I could get it to stabilize at 5.5-7 hours. For the price and specs, I am very happy with this battery.

Because of tax you should expect to pay just over or just under $1700 for this laptop. This is about $400 dollars more than the other laptop I was looking at (Dell's G7, which would have been ~$1300 after tax). However, as a Best Buy member you have the option for point rewards, and I am expecting ~$80 in rewards certificates from this purchase. Also, posting a review for this model qualifies you to receive a free headset worth about $50. Because this is money I already planned to spend on some new games and because I was in need of a new headset, the difference between this and the G7 was more like $270. To me, an extra $270 for a better GPU (1060 vs 1060maxq), a brighter screen, ~2-3 more hours of battery life, and a much more portable form factor was very worth it. 

TLDR; The value of this laptop is situational. There are cheaper options out there for only slightly less performance if you can't take advantage of best buy rewards, but for best buy members(card holders), this is a great value buy if you want good battery life, specs, and display, and are in need of a new headset.",tortuga71,Great value if you are a best buy member!,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"I bought this laptop to be a battle station away from my battle station. I need this for school, work and play. I'm on the go a LOT, so after looking at specs and the reviews I decided to buy this bad boy.

PROS: This laptop is aesthetically appealing. I love it's slender look, and the RBG keyboard is 10/10. The steel series keyboard is also lovely for a laptop. It's fast. Programs open up as intended, and I can multitask fluidly. 

-Not much bloatware!

-The screen is great with true colors when watching movies or gaming.

-Speakers aren't a bad quality on their own.

CONS: Right away I had issues with installing updates with drivers for both the CPU and GPU. Once I updated the GPU there was a sound issue to where the driver for sound was deleted and basically undetectable from my laptop. After a couple of hours from Google Search sounds work now! 

-I'm not a fan of the track pad at all. It has a tendency to zoom in and out unwarranted, so even simple web browsing isn't so great with it.

-The power button is in an obscure spot IMO. When I try to move it towards me or off of my lap to set down, I have a tendency to hit it, or touch it. 

-It DOES indeed get hot, but I've only noticed it with one specific game. I've played Rocket League, Civ 5 & 6, and The Witcher 3 so far on this thing. Only Witcher 3 was the one that made it uncomfortably hot. I'm trying some new balanced performance settings (setting battery and cpu to 60%) to see if it helps with the heat. I'll defintiely update the review after trying some FPS games.

So far it's a mixed experience for me. I was honestly debating on this and the ASUS ROG. For a work horse laptop and using it for work tasks like Adobe Photoshop, or for online classes and work, this laptop is great and I would recommend it, but for longtime gaming on the go, I'm pretty mixed on it.",Chowder,We've Only Just Begun...,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",4
"I recently purchased the MSI GS63 Stealth (intel 8th generation), after having my 7th generation experienced hard drive failure. Instead of bestbuy sending it out, they gave me credit for it and I purchased this newer, 8th gen version.
 I loved my 7th gen, everything about it just felt great, a perfect size, ran any games that I wanted at max settings, and was extremely portable. If anything the 8th generation version has only improved.
 So far, unlike with the previous models, I havent had any direct hardware issues, so that's definitely a plus. I had many hardware failures with the previous gen, internal mic broken/wireless card. Then total ram failure. Then hardware failure. Each time Best Buy replaced the computer for free and I still picked up the same 7th gen MSI GS63.
 Seems like I shouldve just switched and thats what people told me, but this computer is exactly what I want in a computer. To me, bulky laptops defeat the purpose, if I had to sit with a 10 pound computer on my lap or carry around I might as well get a desktop. This is the perfect size. very comfortable just keeping on your lap or stomach. The keyboard feels great and looks great too, it's not one big sheet of keys nor does it have any of those annoying bumps. The track pad is also nice texture. It can play any game I want, from an emulation that's high in CPU usage to any of the labor intesive AAA games on max. The entire suite of operations from MSI is fantastic and makes it easy for anyone to learn how to overclock or manage other settings safely. This is all about the previous model as well, but it is definitely the same with the 8th gen processor model here.
 Here's a small list of things that I feel have become even better since its last iteration:

-Boot up is even faster
-New shell is less prone to finger prints
-Higher quality display (Colors feel deeper and richer)
-More customizable keyboard and general settings (Quality of life things are often overlooked)
-Slightly smoother
-Better at multitasking for everyday use
-The cooling system (fans) are insane now
-Batterly life feels much much better, feels like hours more of streaming, games, and general use.

These feel like small adjustment that make a computer I enjoyed a great deal, even better.

"What is a gaming laptop? Is it a purpose built machine? A style of computer? Or is it something more? The Acer Nitro 5 Ryzen attempts to be all of that on a budget and does a fairly good job with some rough edges. The good news is the worst of those edges is software that is already being addressed.

First of all, if you’ve viewed an Acer gaming laptop, either another Nitro or the higher end Predator laptops - this model will look quite familiar. The main body is nearly identical across most of their line, but the lids are different. The Nitro 5 here has a plastic carbon fiber-look textured lid. In some ways this is an improvement from the metal ones found on higher end models, since fingerprints aren’t as much of a problem. Scratch will probably be hidden quite well over time - I see this laptop aging well. Internally the surface of the laptop is made of a hard smooth plastic w/ carbon fiber accents. Considering the material choice, it feels quite premium. The bezel around the screen is a bit thick and the plastic here isn’t quite the same premium feel, which is no big deal. There is a 1 MP camera up top that is probably the noisest camera in low-light I have ever experienced - you won’t want to use this camera for streaming. Finally the hinge area is covered in a maroon acer red with the word ‘NITRO’ embossed in it.

The underbody includes 2 access doors - 1 for RAM, which reveals an empty slot for another stick of DDR4, and the other access to a 2.5” SATA drive bay, left empty w/ its sata cable dangling. Certainly if you had an extra HD or SSD, you could readily plug it in here. The m.2 slot is hidden behind more screws, and further surgery would be required to free it, however even without removing the bottom panel complete, I can surmise this isn’t a difficult task.

The keyboard seems improved from other models (albeit I don’t own any, but have typed a bit in store). The backlighting is a solid red with black keycaps and transparent sides. This allows the keys to glow around the edges which look quite nice. The WASD quad’s transparent edges wrap around the top of the key setting these off and glowing brighter. The keys are soft in action, and the keyboard is quite quiet. The main keys are full sized, but the F-row are tiny. One trick I learned that in the BIOS you can set the F-row keys to be their media functions if you want by default. Centered below home row is a generously sized trackpad provided by ELAN, which supports Windows 10 multi-touch gestures. I was stuck using it for a bit of Overwatch and had trouble with it responding. I believe it was probably the size combined with gesture recognition that was probably causing my issues.

The body in general offers a pretty good selection of ports. The left side includes back to front respectively a kensington lock, gigabit ethernet, USB-C, HDMI, USB 3, full size SD card slot. The right side is the power jack, charging/power indicator leds, 2 USB ports and a 3.5mm AHJ headphone jack (combo mic/headphones). Around front you’ll find two front firing speakers which function adequately.

The included power adapter is a 135w model. This adapter must be a trickle down from other models, as it seems quite a bit oversized for a 15w-25w TDP CPU and a 65w TDP GPU.

Speaking of the internal hardware - the star of the show is the Ryzen 5 2500u. This 15w TDP part not only brings 4 cores and 8 threads to the table, but essentially can hang w/ Intel’s previous 45w i7 Skylake/Kabylake parts. Now newer i7 8750H cpus will burn it, but it’s a very strong performer given it’s thermal design, and includes an embedded Vega graphics w/ 512 Shader units. The Vega is almost overkill for an embedded GPU here, but it’s part of the Ryzen mobile platform. I only wish they’d have figured out hybrid crossfire to bolster up the dedicated GPU. The iGPU does consume 1GB of the main system ram, so that is one downside.

The RX 560X is the GPU found in this laptop. The RX 560X is a fully realized Baffin core with 1024 shader units @ 1275MHz, 16 ROPs, and 4GB of GDDR5 ram @ 5.8GHz. Baffin is the Polaris 11 GPU that has been the basis of the RX 460/560 desktop cards and sits on the low-mid range market (about $100-150 desktop GPU price). This example performs in line with its configuration benefiting from a full complement of shaders and the higher end clock speed, but still it’s a bit of a letdown given the capabilities of the CPU. Essentially the older mid-range 7850 desktop card from 2012 shares a similar configuration and performance figure. That said, for this laptop's intended audience, it performs quite well.

I played a few rounds of Overwatch - and while there were a few lags here and there (seemed IO related), the framerate held around 70FPS @ 1080p w/ high settings. Likewise, CS:GO returned similar performance, dipping down into the mid-50s on occasion w/ high settings @ 1080p. Where things started to break down was Dark Souls 3. The default set the game w/ high settings at 1080p. This was a framerate disaster - and while not specifically unplayable, it was dipping down into the mid-20 FPS. Backing the resolution down to 720p shored up the framerate - pushing it up to 60 FPS cap for a majority of the time. Switching graphics options up and down didn’t have much of an impact in this game. A 3dmark synthetic benchmark can be found: https://www.3dmark.com/fs/15958731 - reaching 5400 points - a solid mid-range score.

One thing that was apparent during play, was that initial loading seemed quite stuttery, as if loading textures and resources was taking longer than it should. I’m not sure, but the SK Hynix 256GB m.2 sata drive might have been to blame. At least it is an SSD, but the 4k random reads were particularly poor. That said reads sequentially were in the 450MB/s range, while writes were generally slower around 250MB/s. Overall, I’ll take it over a spinning platter any day, but there are higher performing options out there that are pretty affordable. At this price point, it's probably too much to wish for NVMe PCIe, but I would have wanted to see a better unit, either from sandisk or toshiba that might have kept things smooth.

The screen is an LG AH-IPS panel w/ DC LED backlighting (yay - for no PWM - flicker free!). It’s not particularly color accurate, or bright, but it has good viewing angles and almost no backlight bleed. Yes, and IPS panel that doesn’t look like a mess on a black screen. It glows, but has great uniformity. Of course it’s 1080p, so the resolution is pretty good for a 15.6” screen. Windows is set to 125% scaling out of the box. If you’re a power user, I’d suggest trimming that to 100% to avoid scaling bugs, and enjoy the extra real-estate the 1080p screen buys you.

Overall the experience with this laptop has been positive. There were a few bugs - specifically as some have mentioned: a power management issue w/ the Ryzen chip. My CPU would get stuck at 400MHz and never leave it’s 4x multiplier. I tried many different options, but my final approach was simply to upgrade the BIOS. The 1.08 BIOS appears to fix this issue. Likewise the RX560X and Vega combo is somewhat of a new configuration, so the latest AMD drivers did not work (stay w/ Acer’s provided drivers). I also fought the Nitro sense control panel quite a bit. I couldn’t get a custom fan profile to work, only ‘Auto’ and ‘Max’. Max sounds like a hair dryer, and frankly, I doubt you’ll mess with these settings - as in my testing neither CPU or GPU got over the mid-60C’s w/ the auto profiel and are designed for much higher temps. I did get stuck at the ‘Max’ setting and had to reinstall Nitro Sense (hint, the windows service that runs the fan control is called ‘Predator Service’ not ‘Nitro Service’ as the installer would have you believe). There is also coolboost, which will increase fan speeds essentially all the time. 

There isn't too much just software installed. Just your normal complement of OEM apps (Acer Care Center was actually pretty helpful). Acer Collection is useless, and Acer power button seems like a hold-over from the Windows 8 days when people had trouble figuring out how to turn off their computer. Norton is here, and easy enough to uninstall (I just use the out of the box MS protection).

In conclusion the Nitro 5 Ryzen is a good entry level gamer, with some teething issues. The 400MHz bug took me by surprise, and I’m a pretty serious power user/enthusiast. The Nitro sense fan control also was kludgy and half worked. The CPU performed great after the BIOS update - and you’d be hard pressed to find a better performing CPU/iGPU in this class of machine. The dedicated GPU in my opinion is a bit of a letdown, and only highlights the huge gulf of performance between the low-mid and upper-mid range cards (like the GTX 1060 or 580X). This won't allow AAA titles w/ many options on and require backing the resolution down as well, so keep that in mind.

Still this is a decent piece of equipment when you take the price into consideration. The build is solid, materials durable, thermal design will keep up during gaming sessions, keyboard is great, trackpad is good and large, screen is excellent in its class. The biggest cons are going to be driver maturity, an GPU just one performance class ahead of the iGPU, the general chunkiness of the build, and weight (both laptop and power brick). Frankly though - given the price these are easy to live with, and with back to school season approaching this is a great laptop to keep in consideration for students on a budget - especially if they like PC gaming.",aarondr,"Solid entry level, wish GPU had more kick",7,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX 560X - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",4

PC Gaming might not get the media attention it once did with high power consoles now available, but that doesn’t mean PC gaming is dead. If it has done anything, it has evolved. Although extremely expensive gaming rigs are still available, the real expansion has been on more affordable gaming rigs. With fast processors now less battery hungry and more affordable, mobile gaming is now within reach of more casual gamers.

The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-42-R5GT is Acer’s Ryzen 5 offering for 2018 in this popular category. The Nitro 5 series laptops are more affordable gaming laptops with reasonable specs and an accompanying reasonable price tags, albeit with hard to remember names for each. Specs for the AN515-42-R5GT include an AMD Ryzen 5 2500U processor, 8GB of memory, a 256GB M.2 SSD, dedicated Radeon RS 560X GPU, and an IPS screen to boot. The top shell is faux carbon fiber with a textured finish and the palm rest is a smooth finish faux carbon fiber. There are a few, conservative red accents throughout the laptop but overall the look is very subtle for a gaming laptop. If you keep the bright red keyboard backlight off, this could be used in a professional environment without getting any weird looks.

As an entry level gaming laptop, compromises must be made. The challenge is making the right compromises. On the Nitro 5, each component is configured with a lower, mid-range part that is properly sized to not create a bottleneck in any one area. A refreshing change is seeing an included SSD in the mix, albeit a slower one that tops out at about 225MBps. The included 8GB of memory includes an extra slot to allow expansion to dual channel for some added future upgrades. If you need to include some extra storage down the road there is extra hard drive bay that is accessible. Even the screws are included. This is nice as it allows the system to be a little more future proof without breaking the bank. Of course, the display panel is not the highest end, but it is quite good with reasonable color accuracy and good viewing angles. Brightness is good, but gaming outdoors would be near impossible. The speakers are similarly good, but not stellar. The speakers mainly fire downward, so the choice of surface greatly affects sound output and quality. Place it on a hard surface and you have ample volume with acceptable range. Place it on a soft surface and muffled sounds should be expected. Considering the air intake for cooling is also on the bottom, a hard surface is the safer bet for longevity.

If there were any real compromise with the system, it would have to be the battery. During light duty use, such as browsing the web and watching videos, expect about 4 hours of battery life with 20% screen brightness. This is surprising considering the Ryzen 5 runs ice cold compared to other gaming laptops. It never showed signs of thermal throttling. During stress testing, temps refused to go much higher than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. No part of the laptop seemed to get very warm and the air was just slightly warm from the cooling fans. If it ever did get hot the cooling fans should be able to do the job. On high with CoolBoost turned on they put out a large volume of air with nothing more than the sound of air rushing. With no sign of high power consumption since it runs so cool, the only assumption could be the included battery is very low capacity. Either way, don’t expect to get a full day out of this battery. When gaming, battery life isn’t much of a concern since most will keep it plugged in for maximum performance but having such short battery life for casual use in 2018 is a bit surprising.

The entire keyboard has a red backlight with the WASD keys having bolder lettering and larger light ring. It is a chicklet style keyboard that makes very little sound decent travel and a soft feel. This is helpful when you are in a quiet meeting, but it does lend to make presses feel less precise than compared to Cherry MX or other mechanical switches. It might take some adjustment but if you can get over the feeling, the responsiveness and accuracy is quite good. Spacing is also very good allowing you to quickly find the precise key you want with good separation between keys. This does not carry over to the number pad on the right. The arrow keys, function keys, and number keys are cramped which can cause issues with missed weapons selection. Besides the arrow keys being hard to access quickly, the power button is cramped into the number pad. This could lead to unintentional shutdowns as you try to hit a number. If you use these keys a lot in gaming, a full size USB keyboard should be in order. If you mainly keep to the main part of the keyboard, you should be fine. The trackpad is very responsive with good palm rejection but the same soft feeling when you click the left or right mouse buttons. Considering most gamers use a traditional mouse anyway, this shouldn’t be a big deal. With two standard USB ports, a USB 3.0 port, and a USB-C port you shouldn’t have any problem connection peripherals. You can even take a step further and use the included full-sized HDMI port to connect to a TV for big screen gaming.

Of course, the big question everyone wants to know is how well does it perform? The answer to that question is pretty good actually. Being honest, one shouldn’t look at a laptop in this price range to play any recent title maxed out, but with a little tweaking it does well. That said, if you are up for some old titles like Borderlands 2 or COD have fun maxing out every setting you can. On 3D mark, it scored a 1913. There won’t be any playing Oculus on this rig. However; if you are looking at an Oculus then your budget is already much higher. With no other process applications running, NitroSense on max with CoolBoost enabled, 3d Mark turned in 12FPS with a maximum CPU temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit and GPU temperature of 129 degrees. Without using benchmark software that is behind a paywall it is hard to confirm, but in basic tests the included Radeon RX650X is performing slightly better than a GTX1050. Combine that with the fact that during multiple passes the thermals stayed well in the green and you have a nice budget gaming system. Even more impressive is how quickly the temps would drop after the load was removed. You shouldn’t have any worries of thermal throttling or premature failure due to repeated heat stress. A nice side effect is that since it runs so cool you can use it safely on your lap without the worry of getting burned while squeezing every bit of performance out of the system. 

Overall, the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-42-R5GT is a solid offering in the entry gaming laptop segment as well a good laptop overall. Based on the design, it seems like Acer is targeting budget minded gamers who need a multipurpose computer, such as a college student. With a well-rounded specs, for a good price, future upgrade options, and only minor compromises the Acer Nitro 5 is a very compelling budget gaming laptop.",CraigB,Cool running entry level gaming laptop,2,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX 560X - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"The Acer nitro 5 offers a gaming laptop that should fit just about any gaming need you may have. With AMD's 560X graphics gaming card you should be able to play with just about any game thats out there with a breeze. AMD's set up i think can be arguably compared to Nvidias GTX 1050TI which is a very good entry level card. With the ability to switch to vega 8 for power concerns this laptop will be able to adapt based on its environment. 

Out of the box this is a very nice and simplistic looking laptop. Its not over the top in the way of design and offers a key layout which should suit just about most gamers out there. The WASD layout is very nice and visible and the key back lighting is done nice. One drawback is that i wish the keyboard had more color options or even the ability to dim the lights. They are either on or off. The laptop offers an IPS display which im not too fond of as they usually are not that bright or vibrant. However the screen display was very bright with vibrant colors which was a breath of fresh air. With the IPS display don't expect to game or stream in 4k either. The speakers put out decent sound but this shouldn't be an issue as most gaming is done with headphones on anyways. I got about 3 hours of battery life before needing a charge on medium settings. There is also no CD drive so keep that in mind when purchasing. This is not a big issue for me as i do alot of gaming on Steam anyways.

I don't want to drag this on with the specifics as all the specs can be found here on Best Buy. What i want to do is really focus on what this laptop was meant to do which is gaming and how well it can handle it in to the longer hours. One of the biggest issues i have noticed with some of the lower end laptops in my past is issues with heat distribution during the longer hours of gaming. This laptop does pretty well into the longer hours while playing some of the older games like civilization on the higher settings. I didn't really feel it start to heat up till about the third hour. However while playing Call of Duty i started to really notice the heat temperature rise well in to the end of the first hour. Granted my settings were maxed out but the heat never got to the point where i felt i could not lay it on my lap. Taking apart the laptop was easier than i thought it would be and once apart i noticed the fan layout. I noticed they put the fans side by side instead of separating them on opposite ends for better heat distribution. Now i didn't want to mess the laptop up taking apart the heat channels to see if they ran to their own separate fan but by the looks of it, it looked as if they pull from the same junction which seems kinda of like a waste and may be why it heated up rather quickly. Either way about 3 hours in to my game my temperature seemed to stabilize and i saw no issues from this in the form of frame rate drop or lag. Im used to gaming with Nvidia set up and don't have too much experience with just how well AMD's radeon can perform so i put it to the test while playing Fortnite. While playing and maxing out all my settings in game i got a very good and smooth 80 frames. I was really impressed and even how to double check to make sure i wasn't reading that wrong. It just seemed almost unrealistic for a laptop to run that smooth and during some of my high action fighting there was never once any drop outs or lag issues. In the past when i run my settings on max load they usually give me a disadvantage as there tends to be hiccups in the display and i usually end up dead before i get a chance to line up my target. This was not an issue here at all. While playing Call of Duty, action sequences were smooth and color display was vibrant throughout the whole game with no visible streaking. Having a built in web cam with mic also was a nice feature to have for some live streaming. Although i never really utilized the cam during gaming i had no issues setting it up and using it to chat with some friends. Display was smooth and streaming was very fluid with no blurs or lag.

Here's the bottom line. This is an awesome set up for entry level to moderate gamers. Heat dissipation is not the best but its not horrible either and does not seem to effect game play. The only thing that kinda of worries me a bit is the fact that i have only put a week of testing in to this. In the past i have seen and heard mix reviews of Acers line up for gaming laptops and while this is the first one i have owned i would keep in mind that there have been issues with screen displays going out. Now while i wanted to throw that out there for you i want you to also know that i have at this time yet to run in to any issues. Everything has been flawless and quite impressive that i am in almost disbelief that this laptop runs this good. I just hope that this can stand the test of time but if that is a concern of yours as it is mine my suggestion would be get this laptop as it is a good gaming laptop just make sure to get a warranty and you should be good to go.",Crasher,Great entry level laptop,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX 560X - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-42-R5GT is a 15.6 inch Full HD display laptop computer marketed with an 8 GB RAM, 256 Solid State Drive (SSD), weighs just under 6 pounds and is a touch over 1 inch thick. The Nitro is preloaded with Windows 10, which is the newest Microsoft operating system which will need updating as soon as you power-up your new system. The update of the operating system went smoothly.

The supplied 8 GB of Ram is pretty standard for a newly configured laptops, and should be able to provide most consumers advanced multitasking options whereby enabling them to do several things simultaneously without any hick-ups. This is a nice capability if you are one of those users that tends to have several large programs open at the same time. This will also help you achieve smoother gaming as the Nitro has 6 cores and 12 processing capabilities. The Nitro 5 does not have a GTX1050 TI graphics card, so if this is a must for you, consider a different laptop choice.

The Nitro 5 laptop comes standard with a 256GB SSD which does not offer a plethora of storage, but you can always upgrade the system if you desire. The smaller storage capability was not a deal breaker for me, as I use online storage for my vast photo collections. Honestly speaking, I would rather have a SSD with no moving parts, which provides faster start ups and reduced heat production and power drain on the battery. If you have never experienced a start up with a SSD you are in for a surprise. SUPER FAST!

Inside the Nitro 5 is a AMD Radeon RX 560X graphics card backed with 4GB GDDR5 dedicated video memory which provides faster video memory and an advanced Graphics Processing Unit. This unit will supercharge your gaming experience. The laptop does not have a DVD/CD drive which makes the unit lighter and has a 4-cell lithium-ion battery. If you want this capability, you will have to purchase a separate unit.

I've used this laptop quite extensively after unpacking. I found that the laptop did not become hot after long periods of use, but it did become warm. It's performance easily handled my games with no problems.

The Nitro has HD Webcam to include a microphone meaning that you don't have to go out and purchase separately in order to use SKYPE or the WHATSAP. Having an available webcam definitely makes sense for a laptop. Also standard with this product is a media reader for transferring your photographs. It does support SD memory card formats.

The Nitro is a magnet for fingerprint oil. The trackpad or surface of the laptop does not show visible finger prints, but it does show the oil from your fingers and hands. I have another Nitro laptop which also suffers this symptom. The keyboard has a very solid feel to it, and I did not experience any flex or bending. The keyboard has the option of backlighting which is great, especially if you use your laptop in a dimly or darkened room. One note on the usage of this keyboard (backlighting in off position) is that I personally found it difficult to see letters and numbers on the keyboard even if there was sufficient lighting in the room. What that translates into is basically using a lit keyboard all the time.

The screen is matte and has very nice colors to it. Viewing angles are decent even if you are not sitting directly in back of the screen. No complaints at all.

The verdict on the Nitro 5? Nice laptop, superfast, great startup time, and overall decent performance for the budget conscious. Nice laptop.

"Today, I am looking at Acer’s Nitro 5 Gaming laptop (AN515-42-R5GT). I was particularly interested because this laptop features the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U Processor at 2GHz (turbo boost at 3.6GHz), VEGA integrated graphics and a Radeon RX 560X GPU with 4GB GDDR5 memory. I have never used an all-AMD laptop. It has 8GB of DDR4 SDRAM (easily upgradable to 32GB). It comes with 256GB of SSD storage. First, knowing that this is an entry-level gaming laptop, my expectations were not that high. Well, I have had it for a week now and the experience so far has not been disappointing and a little surprising, frankly. This model’s chassis is made entirely of black plastic with a nice accented carbon fiber-looking finish top and carbon graphics on the dash. It weighs a hefty 5.96 lbs. so carrying it around can take some effort requiring a bigger book bag. The swivels are sturdy keeping the screen firm and in place. Overall, it feels well built. Connectivity is not an issue since this model offers a good amount of ports; 2 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3, 1 USB-C 3.1, HDMI 2.0, an Ethernet port, a single audio port and a card reader. It has a standard 720P camera. Now let’s get to the important stuff. Booting up is fast and for the most part, opening and moving between programs is rather smooth and responsive, due to the SSD. The IPS 1080P 60Hz 15.6” screen is a bit dim being about only 250 nits, and more on the warm side. The keyboard feels responsive with nice clicking and travel. However, the layout takes some time getting used to, especially because the delete and right shift keys are on the small side. The trackpad feels very smooth and responsive, easily detecting most gestures. The audio, as expected from most laptops, is nothing to get excited about -it is decent and loud, but with no bass at all. It does feature Dolby Audio so using headphones is basically a must. As far as performance, this laptop does rather well. Doing minor video and sound editing is not a problem. It is not blazing fast, but acceptable. It is a great device for productivity. Being marketed as a gaming laptop, it can give the impression to casual PC users that it will play the latest and more demanding games at the highest settings. That is not the case. I ran a few benchmarks and found that this is more of an entry to mid-level gaming rig. I ran tests using the 3DMark’s tool. It scored 15136 on Sky Diver, 5344 on Fire Strike and 1937 on Time Spy. These numbers are not bad, but far away from top scores. For a better perspective, DOOM on Ultra settings ran at a nice 70-90 FPS, Fallout 4 at high settings at 60-70 fps. However, I was shocked that I had to play Fortnite on medium settings to keep the frame rate at 60FPS and even then, it dipped occasionally. Of course, this does not matter if you are not used to playing games on high-end PC’s and most games look and perform better than on a dedicated console. I will have to say that the PC runs on the hot side, even though it features CoolBoost Technology. The cooling fans can get very loud, and they are strangely located on the right side only. Also, because this laptop has only 256GB of space, very few games can be installed. However, installing a second hard drive is incredibly easy as this laptop offers easy access to the bay without dismantling the whole computer. The same if you want to upgrade the memory (which you should immediately). As far as the battery, it will provide about 4 hours during regular work, 2-3 hours while watching video content and about 1.5 hrs. when playing games or editing videos. Overall, this is a great value entry-level laptop that will not break the bank. At the suggested retail price, I will highly recommend it if you are mainly focusing on productivity with some gaming sprinkled in between -but do not forget to upgrade space and memory right away!",insomniak1,Great value for entry-level gaming.,2,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX 560X - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5

"The Dell G7 is the successor to the Inspiron 15 7000 series and does an excellent job at improving upon the previous design aesthetic while also delivering outstanding performance for the price.

BUILD:
In terms of the build and construction, the G7’s housing is primarily plastic, but has a rigidity that prevents it from feeling cheap. In terms of the aesthetic, Dell is going for a simpler, more elegant design that is unlike their Alienware series laptops. There’s very little about this laptop that screams “gamer”, and I certainly like that about it, as I’m not only just a gamer, but a software engineer. Laptops that one can use in professional situations as well as for gaming are becoming more popular nowadays, and Dell’s G7 is a solid response to that demand. But like any other laptop, I wouldn’t dare let this suffer a drop, as the build materials likely won’t prove to be resilient to abuse.

DISPLAY:
The 15” 1080p IPS display is quite good on the G7. My unit has the AUO63ED panel which people online have overclocked to 100Hz and beyond (albeit at risk of warranty). Other units have had an LG display which did not achieve such overclocks. The display is matte, so you won’t suffer from tons of reflectivity, and it gets decently bright for most situations. For gamers and typical users, you will enjoy using this display.

KEYBOARD:
The keyboard is one of the things about this laptop that is taking some getting used to. I’m personally accustomed to mechanical keyboards as well as chiclet keyboards. However, both other high-end laptops that I own have better key travel in my opinion, and that’s largely due to the wider spacing between the keys on the G7 as well as the minimal height on the keys. It’s not as though the G7’s keyboard is bad, but my fingers are certainly more accustomed to keys with closer travel and a slightly larger key height. The ones on the G7 are just a bit more recessed compared to what I’m used to. I do want to emphasize that these are observations and my opinions; your experience my differ from mine. Additionally, the keyboard is backlit (blue); I do wish it was white instead, as blue can be fatiguing over time, but I’m not sure if this minimal amount will result in any noticeable impact. When the backlight is on, it has two brightness modes, but there isn’t too much difference between them. The WASD keys also have blue squares around them when the keyboard is backlit, but it’s not something I noticed until just now. If they wanted it to stand out more, they should have opted for a different color like white. Another interesting note is that the keyboard backlight turns off after a minute, but will turn back on once a key is pressed. As far as I’ve seen, I don’t think there’s a way to configure this. If there was, I’d expect it to be in the UEFI/BIOS (F2 upon boot).

TOUCHPAD:
The G7 has a Precision Touchpad which is decently large and has good palm rejection, as well. From my usage, it’s quite responsive to gestures as well as general usage, otherwise. One thing that I don’t like as much is that there are no separate mouse left-click/right-click buttons. It’s not a big deal, but I came from another gaming laptop that had them. The G7, in contrast, has very clicky touchpad mouse buttons which some may enjoy, and others may not. If you have to work in a quiet environment, you will tapping to click instead of pressing in the integrated buttons. Other than these nitpicks, I do enjoy using the trackpad and the gestures within Windows 10.

I/O:
The G7 is equipped with some pretty standard I/O compared to most laptops in this price bracket and demographic. It has 3x USB-A 3.1, 1x USB-C 3.1 (with Thunderbolt), HDMI 2.0, a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone combo jack, a full-size SD card slot, and an RJ45 gigabit ethernet port. I do wish some of these ports were located on the back, just below the hinge, but that kind of design hasn’t hit the mainstream yet.

STORAGE:
The model I have came equipped with a Toshiba KSG60ZM 256GB NVMe SSD which claims to support 1500 MB/s read and 760 MB/s write. If you’re used to hard drives, this will be a lovely change, but if you’re used to absolute top-tier NVMe SSD’s like I am, you may consider swapping it out. It does support both an m.2 SSD (SATA or PCIe NVMe), as well as a standard SATA 2.5” HDD/SSD. By default, this the G7 has RAID enabled in the BIOS to use the Intel Rapid Storage Technology NVMe controller drivers. If you decide to swap out this drive and use manufacturer drivers over AHCI mode, do a google search on ""SOLUTION: Switch Windows 10 from RAID/IDE to AHCI operation"". This will let you switch to AHCI without reinstalling windows.

RAM:
My unit came with 8GB of RAM in total (2x4GB DIMM). This is a bit underwhelming, especially given the horsepower this machine has, otherwise. I would have liked to see 16GB. But if this product is focused on gamers, then the 2x4GB dual-channel memory configuration may have a sizeable enough impact on framerate to justify this decision. Even so, I do think 16GB is a much better choice for individuals like myself who would like to use this computer as a mobile workstation for professional purposes. In the end, I may have to shell out the additional high cost and max this machine out with 2x16GB for a total of 32GB.

CPU:
The i7-8750H is overkill for most people, but I’m not most people. As a software engineer, I’ve been dying to have more cores in a laptop at this price and configuration. With a total of 12 logical threads, this laptop can do heavy multitasking like running a full suite of docker containers for an enterprise environment (assuming you have the RAM to match). If you’re a game streamer using OBS or similar software that relies on CPU, you may appreciate the extra cores; however, most games won’t benefit a whole lot from the additional cores. That may change in the future, but the majority of today’s titles won’t see improvement from the increase in core count. In general, expect solid multitasking performance. That being said, this CPU runs hot, and undervolting -0.125V using ThrottleStop or Intel XTU can achieve lower thermals—especially considering that the CPU and GPU expel hot air through the same heat pipe. Just keep in mind that undervolting is done at your own risk and is not supported by the manufacturer.

GAMING:
The G7 is equipped with an Nvidia GTX 1060 Max Q. This puts it between the performance of the GTX 1050 Ti and the GTX 1060. As someone who has a custom-built desktop that is much faster than the Dell G7 (but cost way more money to do so), The G7 is really an excellent value and delivers a gaming experience that I am very satisfied with. The Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark was able to pull 60+ fps while set to the Very High preset under DX12 with exclusive fullscreen, FXAA and Vsync off at 1080p. That being said, a more stable framerate with fewer skips can be easily obtained under the “High” preset or by making your own fine-tuned adjustments. Competitive eSports games will also hit well over the 60fps mark. When pushing the graphical limits, this laptop can get loud and can take some time to cooldown after a gaming session. Proper airflow/ventilation will be important in obtaining reasonable temperatures, and undervolting the CPU can also help improve this.

SOUND:
As far as the speakers are concerned, they’re decent. Definitely wish they had a subwoofer bass port to improve frequencies in that range, but that’s a sacrifice Dell chose to make in this design. That being said, I have used cheaper gaming laptops from 2017 which did have better bass response and got louder than the G7 while also maintaining clarity. I don’t think the G7 is disappointing on this front, but I'm also not wowed by their solution. Regardless, I'm happy enough with the solution.

CONCLUSION:
The G7 is an excellent deal with few compromises compared to other laptops in a similar price bracket. I’ve mostly nitpicked in this review, but despite its few minor flaws, it’s an excellent laptop; one that I’m glad to be using and wouldn’t have issues recommending for the price. In fact, I have just ordered an even faster NVMe SSD and 32GB to make the G7 my primary mobile workstation.",Xephyroth,King of Gaming / Workstation Laptops for < $1K,26,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",4
"Dell has been in the PC market for years. And they tend to make good quality desktop and laptop PCs without needing to be overly flashy. I guess that makes them more suitable to people who prefer the utilitarian style. But because Dell has been in the PC market for so long, it’s difficult to figure out what exact type and model you’re getting.

The model being reviewed here is a G7 Series 15 7588. It features an Intel Core i7 8750H processor that has 6 cores capable of 12 threads of execution. In layman terms, it means it can do more without bogging down your system. It has 8GB of RAM which should allow you to run several softwares at once. However, when it comes to gaming, more is usually better. 8GB is enough for most games today. Going forward, that may change. The 8GB of RAM is rated at DDR4 2666 or PC4 21300 and is preinstalled in 2x4GB. Upgrading the memory will mean purchasing a new set (in a pair) rather than a single. For storage, a 256GB SSD is installed using a M.2 interface. Dell’s support documentation list procedures for both M.2 and SATA drives but confusingly labels the 2.5” drive as hard drive and the M.2 as “Solid State Drive.” (Note: SSD can come in either 2.5” drive form factor using SATA interface or M.2 form factor.)

The laptop features a 15.6 inch display with a 1920x1080 resolution on a IPS panel. That display is powered by both Intel’s integrated graphics and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 “Max-Q” GPU. There is a dedicated 6GB of video memory which will allow the GPU to perform better without relying on system memory and its limited bandwidth. The performance review of the 1060 GPU will come shortly.

On the audio side, it is powered by RealTek and has stereo speakers on the front side of the laptop. However, the laptop design itself is angled so the speakers are aimed downwards. Unfortunately, the speakers aren’t all that good and doesn’t have good range on them. They’re more on the high side and the bass/lows are very lacking. (Tested using a few Beatles songs and Luv(sic) Part 2 by Nujabes) The only way to potentially get a better audio experience will be to use your own headphones, either through Bluetooth or the 3.5mm headphone jack.

Moving on, the keyboard is backlit and dims after a period of inactivity. The A, S, D, W keys have additional backlit design to let users easily find these movement keys. There is a number pad to the right. But given that this is supposed to be a gaming laptop, I wonder if this is a good design decision to include it. I suppose some MOBA players can use these for shortcuts. On the top of the keyboards are your usual function keys as well as special keys. By default, the special keys are enabled by default. To use the F1 through F12, one has to press and hold down the “Fn” key first. I’m fairly certain this behavior can be changed within the laptop’s BIOS/firmware.

On the connectivity front, there is a Gigabit Ethernet port, 3 USB 3.x ports, a USB3 Type-C port with Thunderbolt, a HDMI port, and a SD Card reader. Unfortunately, I do not have any Thunderbolt devices to plug into the Type-C port to test its capability. But it is comforting to know that one can plug one to the laptop for a variety of things. The Gigabit Ethernet port worked as expected and I was able to transfer about 36GB of data from my desktop over to the laptop. The bandwidth was saturated close to its maximum speed and made transferring the entire Guild Wars 2 data file very fast. The laptop’s wireless capability is powered by Intel Wireless AC-9560, which can handle 802.11ac standards. According to the product documents on Intel’s website, it also can handle Bluetooth 5.0. For wireless networking, observed speeds topped off at around 100mbit/s.

The laptop comes preinstalled with Windows 10 Home edition. This is the lowest full edition Windows 10 one can get. But at the same time, it’s a bit disappointing. While the feature differences between Home and Pro is fairly small, one feature that could be a plus for gamers is being able to defer and delay Windows Update through Group Policy. Group Policy editing is not included in WIndows 10 Home which could have helped in managing some of the other minor annoyances in Windows 10. As expected of any laptops and pre-made desktops, it comes with some additional software preinstalled. McAfee Security is also preinstalled but I have personally opted to not set it up or removed it entirely. The very thought of needing to pay after the free subscription expires bothers me.

On the gaming department, I ran around in Guild Wars 2 on battery power. With that alone powering the GPU, it barely handles 30fps in crowded areas. Unfortunately, Guild Wars 2 is one of those games where you won’t get better framerate with a faster video card. Instead, it’s heavily reliant on how fast your processor is. Other games tested within the limited time I’ve spent with the laptop are “Ikaruga,” “Mark of the Ninja,” and “Dust: An Elysian Tail.” All of them performed great as expected due to the abundance of processing power of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060.

In terms of battery life, the laptop can get by on normal operations for 4-5 hours. In gaming, and depending on the game itself, that will knock it down even further. On the other hand, if you’re going to be gaming, your best bet is to simply plug the laptop to the AC. On battery, I was able to run Guild Wars 2 for about 30-45 minutes, plus around 30 minutes of Dust: An Elysian Tail, and a little of Mark of the Ninja and Ikaruga. This is all before the battery level got down to around 21-22%.

There are negative aspects to this gaming laptop. The built-in speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Because of this, you may end up using headphones for better audio listening. The use of Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 Pro restricts the user’s ability to fine tune how Windows operates, especially in the update department. And then there’s the fan. With a powerhouse graphics processor like the 1060, heat is going to be a constant issue. And to cool this GPU down, fans are necessary. There are times when it can get audibly loud. This comes as no surprise for a laptop geared for gaming.

Overall, this is a pretty decent gaming laptop. Granted, I do not have the latest games to push the limit of the laptop. But I am certain it can run most games at decent level. On the other hand, if top performance is what you need, then a laptop should not be the option to take. This is a mid-range gaming laptop. Also consider that this is more of a portable gaming PC than a laptop. At over 5lbs, this is probably better suited at LAN parties instead of sitting at a Starbucks.",Sixshot,Decent gaming laptop,8,1,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",4
"Some things good, others not quite up to snuff. I have Dell's previous Inspiron 15 7000 this is it's successor; got to say dell got some things right and others not quite right. 

Let's start with memory, this unit ships with 8gb, or RAM, but it's 2x4GB sticks, if youe going to stick with 8GB this is best, but if your going upgrade to 16, a 8GB would be preferable (what the previous 7000 series shipped with), now it's faster, but the maching could use up to 32GB, and for a machine with a 6 core processor and 6GB of video memory, it would help substancially with the multi-tesking.

The keyboard, in my opinion is a huge upgade, it's much firmer, the key travel is longer and the spacing of the keys is slightly further apart. The width of is a little greater, and the back-lighting of the keys is done better; the previous version looks/felt like crumbs could get under the keys, not so with the G7.

The track pad is a nice size, that is well positioned, its supports windows 10 gestures; like the previous version it's a little in the clicky side, where using the lowwer buttons requires a real click, some might like this others not, but is a common Dell feature, I've grown to like. The G7 adds backlighting around the track pad which is nice.

The speakers/audio is probably a step down from the previous version which had small sub woofer, which is lacking in the G7, but overall the sound was pretty good; outputing to a set of JBL BT speakers was exceptional, as was streaming to Google devices. Which brings us to the exptional WiFi in the G7, putting the G7 next to my Inspiron 7000, was suprizing; I have 500mb service, and a great WiFi network (3 separate 5G routers); from 30' away the G7 achieved almost 400mb/s whic is the fastest I'd see on my network for a non-wired device (Inspiron 7000 clocked in at 320mb/s). The wired Killer Ethernet connected to the Router hit 450mb/s, peaking close my rated speed of 500. So the networking on the G7 is most excellent.

The display has a nice matt finish IPS screen, it's of angle viewing is superb, the matt finish is a welcome change over the previous hightly reflective screen, much easier to work on, especially with bright lights or sunlight. This really makes the G7 a much better desktop replacement than it's predecesor. The bezel is a little wider, which I think improves the visibility. 

The G7 has all the latest IO ports It has three USB-A 3.1 ports and one USB-C 3.1 (with Thunderbolt [improved]) a HDMI 2.0 port and a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone jack with a full-size SD card slot and gigabit ethernet port (RJ45). All ports are located on the sides as cooling fans blow out the back. I find all of this good.

The G7 came with Toshiba KSG60ZM 256GB NVMe SSD, which I was underwelmed by. There are much faster m.2 drives available, I found this to be a big disapointment. It does support both an m.2 SSD (SATA or PCIe NVMe), and a standard SATA 2.5” drive which can be easily added. A single screw holds on the entire back of the case, removing it and peeling off the back allows easy access to the HD bay and memory. This great feature of the G7, ease of access. Well I had a new 1TB SSD I was dying to try, I dropped it in, and, even thought it used the SATA interface, it was more then twice as fast as the installed Toshiba drive. One other great function include din the G7 is the ability to RAID the m.2 drive and the SATA drive via the Intel Rapid Storage Technology controller, this is a great feature, you should investigate further (not room here).

The i7-8750H CPU is the real bright spot in the G7, I'm a software devloper and do a lot of parallel tasking development, the more cores the less sluggish a PC will seem. Windows (and othe modern OS's) have been changed over the years to be much more modular (so have many modern applications) this modularity excels with more cores/threads; at this price and configuration having a total of 12 threads, this laptop can do real multitasking very smoothly (if you have sufficent memory). This combined with Nvidia GTX 1060 MaxQ w/6GB memory allows modern games to reall run nicely on a notebook. I tried several eSports games all were very smooth, no jitter hitting over 60fps. But the cooling fans of the notebook kicked in blowing more hot air out of the back of the notebook, this is not suprising, and noise from the fans is noticable, but failrly well behaved. Make sure you don't block the rear vents. I also did some photo editing and video processing which very fast and efficient (additional memory would have helped a lot here).

As I said in the begining, there is a lot to like, but a few, primarly fixable (at additional cost) issues. If you look at G7 as it needs to be upgraded to reach it's full potential, then I might recommend it. It's a top notch notebook, great screen, great graphics, nice keyboard/trackpad, that needs more memory to achieve its full potential. It's a cinch to add a top of the line SATA SSD with 1 to 4 TB storage. My biggest issue is the Toshiba m.2; the G7 deserves better and for a nominal cost Dell could have/should have provided it. Upgrading the m.2 drive requires a lot of effort to keep the installed OS, still the i7-8750H is a great advance and ultimate advantage.",3Tcubed,"A good value, that can be improved upon",2,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",4

Among other favorites, my young nephew gets it on with FORTNITE. So, the house upgrade to the DELL G7 was a smart move, especially since his equipment overheats with lots of fan noise way before ready to shut down an extended play. 
Though the machine has a somewhat heavy, rugged exterior that exudes durability; so far, the weight may not be in its capacity to withstand abuse but in its processing power and sharp design features. 
A few small details:
• the hinge allows the top to open without lifting the bottom off the table. 
• the surface deck around the keyboard doesn’t flex under pressure. 
• the panel display has a matte finish with good off angle viewing without glare, good for my business meetings and power point

• Situated at the front edge of the unit, MAXXaudio, affords quite decent clarity for my needs and his

Very pleased with the cpu’s ability to construct and deconstruct docs without resistance while moving large amounts of data with multiple open windows and apps running simultaneously.
For gaming en route, the nephew offers no complaints about the display’s resolution for gaming; and, when, stationary, the interface with an external monitor for a larger view shed is an easy connect.
Says thumbs up for the benefits of Shadow Play pre-installed via GeForce to: 
• analyze the system to judge game compatibility with available space + tolerances, capture game audio + video recordings for uploads to YouTube and the like
• adjust graphics and other settings for best performance. 
• adjust frame rate and audio related parameters as well i.e. in BROADCASTING, fine tune how your game appears.

Happy that the back lit keyboard has a responsive feel and doesn’t misinterpret my key strokes. The back light is a nice upgrade that assists work in low light. DISPLAY SETTINGS offer a few adjustments. 
But, for a next generation upgrade, R+D might consider a broader range of back light color options to satisfy individual preferences, especially since light frequencies have a real impact on emotion and circadian cycles. 
Odd that even though the CAPSLOCK has an indicator light indicating engagement; but, the NUMLOCK doesn’t.
Thankfully, G7 letters, numbers and symbols are imbedded so they won’t dissolve over time as happened with my i5.
When exhausted, keys without letters are a pain. With a memory glitch, I’d have to look at the keys to summon up QWERTY. 
My old Dell keyboard was an easy snap’n lock to replace but not certain if this new version has a similar set up for a la cart replacement.
But, under-side access to the interior is a one screw feature for those who want to enhance. Said to my nephew: “no warranty voiding manipulations allowed!”, especially since he’s already talking overclocking, thermal paste and other techie expansions to keep up with future apps after warranty expiration. He’ll have his own before that time. 
For now, no complaints of ghosting and throttling, especially for the fps he’s getting even while simultaneously engaged. 
A little disappointed with the battery life at 4-5 hrs at medium demand. Really thought battery tech is improving at leaps and bounds enough to afford longer run time at this price point. 
Thankfully, there’s a card reader but installation is not flush. 
And, no DVD/RW; so, get an external or keep the old machine for those occasions. 
Ports are 3 USBs, an HDMI, gaming headset, locking port. 
No fingerprint ID at start up, no pen or touch pad, no back flipping tablet tricks but the fundamentals are solid and a great ROI for the price point. 
Interesting that I don’t feel short changed moving from a 17” display and keyboard to a 15.6”. So, overall, a solid ROI.

"For around $1,000 you get a lot of bang for your buck with this laptop. Keep in mind that this review is about value for the money spent.

Build: the chassis is pretty solid with an efficient cooling design. The bezels are a little big and it is a little heavy, but not unbearable or deal-breakers. 

Keyboard and Trackpad: The keyboard has a pretty nice feel to it when typing and comes with a numeric keypad and a very nice blue backlight. The trackpad is big and gets the job done. However the track pad buttons felt a little unnatural to click, but maybe it's just different from what I'm used to. 

Processor: brand new hexacore with great multi-core performance and turbo boost allows for a lot of smooth multitasking. There are some issues with throttling when running off of the battery, but those could get fixed with future driver / software updates as this is a brand new processor. 

RAM: comes with 8GB running at a very respectable speed of 2666 mHz. It is enough for most people, but it can be upgraded. The downside is that it comes with two sticks of 4GB so you will need to buy two sticks of RAM instead of one to upgrade. 

GPU: This is the Max Q version of the GTX 1060 so expect performance between that of a 1050ti and a regular 1060 but the Max Q is designed to run cooler. With a little overclocking you can get noticeably better performance. In Far Cry 4 I was able to get around 60fps on very high settings, and around 60fps with ultra settings while slightly overclocked. Even when OC'd and during long sessions temperatures never seem to get too high. However there is extreme throttling when running off of the battery, you essentially HAVE to be plugged in to game. 

Screen: the 1080p IPS screen displays as you would expect it. It is a great match for this laptop considering the price and the hardware; the GTX 1060 would not handle anything higher so it would be a waste. 

Battery: the battery does not last very long since it is only 56WHr powering a 45W TDP 6 core processor and a dGPU. And since you need the power adapter to do any gaming, expect to take it with you anytime you leave the house.

Verdict: Very good buy for any casual to moderate PC gamer on a budget. Great performance without paying for extra ""features"" that hardcore PC gamers would look for.",Andy,Great value for Budget gaming laptop,17,1,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",4
"So this Dell G7 is kind of like an update of the Dell Inspiron 7577 from last year. I guess it did so well that Dell decided to just start its own line. It comes in two color schemes. White/blue and a black/blue version. Both look really nice although I think the white/blue is a nice change-up from usual gaming laptops.

Build quality - the chassis is predominantly plastic which is to be expected at this price point. However, the build quality is still very good. There isn't much flex to it. The hinge feels solid and stiff. It feels durable but only time will tell if it holds up. 

Keyboard and Trackpad- I really like the keyboard. The layout is good. Usually 15 inch keyboards with number pads throw me off but I could type easily on this. It feels really good to type on. They're not as responsive as mechanicals or higher end laptops for sure but definitely not a weak point. The backlighting is blue which looks really good. It goes well with the overall look of the laptop. However, it does get a little tiring to the eyes. I actually kept it off at night because the blue light was bothersome which I guess ruined the purpose of backlighting. I think white would have worked better and been less fatiguing on the eyes. Trackpad is ok. Windows precision drivers are always the way to go. The plastic surface is a downer but still good. 

Display - The screen has respectable brightness at 250 nits. Definitely the display is one of the weaker points of the laptop. It is hard to see in sunlight. The color gamut is respectable, but nothing amazing. It is a 60 Hz panel which is pretty standard. The bezels are thick. Makes you go ""what are those??"" in this world of bezeless displays. 

Ports - This laptop has standard ports. It has HDMI which is great. It also has the latest Thunderbolt 3 with 4 lanes of PCI-E so you can run external GPU's like a boss. Also has a headphone jack which may disappear altogether soon. 

Customizing - It is really easy to get into the internals of the laptop and upgrade the internals. This is great in case anything needs replacing or simply if you want to upgrade. I really think more companies should do this...coughcough instead of making people pay higher premiums for bigger specs. 

Battery life - This is one of the compromises. It isn't that great at 56 watt hours. It's mediocre compared to the ultrabooks of today. I was getting 4 hours of battery just browsing the internet. 

Speakers - Ok. I always compare to the Macbook Pros which isn't fair. They can get modestly loud. 

Performance - Yes. This performs so well! It has to do with the new 8th gen 6 core CPU that runs like a beast. Most normal people don't need a quarter of this processing power. However, if you need to run things that need multiple cores then this can do it. That being said, it does run hot. GTX 1060 Max Q is good performance for the money. The fan noise is decent. Definitely lower than I would expect but still audible. This is probably ""loud"" by today's standards. 

All in all, I don't think you can beat the value for the money. Even without that, it is still a decent entry-level gaming laptop for anyone.",sollyp,Not just good value,2,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"First Impression – The Dell G7 comes in a fairly plain box with no frills… kind of underwhelming compared to some of its competitors! That’s OK, because what comes out of the box is a very nice machine that is ready to get down to business.

Setup – Initial setup is typical of just about any Windows computer. In addition to the regular Windows setup routine, Dell has their own and McAfee adds even more to initialize their year of coverage. The blue color of the backlight is a pleasant shade that doesn’t distract but does make every key easy to see.

Use – The touchpad is very large compared to some other brands, allowing easy multi-finger gestures. I reversed the two-finger direction for scrolling so that I can drag down to scroll down and up to go up. The keyboard has the keys in the “right” place, something I’ve come to be aggravated by with some laptops that insist on cramming keys together or putting “Home” and “End” keys as functions of other keys. 

The backlight turns off after a few seconds and is something that does take a little getting used to, but it comes right back on by just swiping the touchpad or tapping a key. Under normal use, the machine stays quite cool but I still use a cooler fan pad to make sure the vents remain unobstructed. 

Upgrading any of the parts is as simple as backing out a single screw and then unsnapping almost the entire bottom of the case. This allows complete access to the M.2 slot, RAM, HD bay, wireless slot and battery. I just wish the machine came with 16GB of RAM since there are reports of difficulties with finding compatible RAM, a machine of this level should come with more than 8GB.

Specs – The G7 is slightly larger than some other 15” laptops with similar specs, but looks even larger because of the angled front and rear edges. The GPU is slightly faster on several benchmarks than an ASUS ROG with a “regular” 1060 video card, even though this is the detuned, cooler version. I updated drivers on both machines and ran them several times to be sure. Battery life is pretty impressive for normal use, but it goes away very quickly when the 1060 is used, as expected. The screen is very bright and clear, as should be with any modern machine.

Connection – The wireless card is stable and connects quickly at startup. I connected the G7 to an Epson EX9220 projector wirelessly and it performed very well, without the need to run cables. As a teacher, the need to connect to my projector is extremely important. I was impressed by how easy it was to connect Windows 10 to the projector! 

Conclusion – I personally prefer the dark color of this model as opposed to the white version, as well as the lack of a gaudy light-up logo on the lid... it has a classy, understated look. After adding a 2.5” 2TB SSHD for storage space (screws and bracket already installed in the bay – thank you, Dell!!!), I have a very powerful machine for both work and play. I look forward to spending more time with this machine, it will be a great asset for me.",Andy,Great Gaming and general use machine,3,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"When it comes to bang for your buck, you can't beat this computer. i was lucky enough to pick it up during the Memorial day sale so I got an even better price for it than full retail, but all things considered it's truly worth every penny.

Pros:
-All the ports are easily accessible, and there are plenty of them to boot - three full USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, HDMI, SD card, and Ethernet. The keyboard is more than comfortable to type on, the screen is really nice, and folds up to a size that's surprisingly comfortable for a ""gaming"" laptop.
-As far as performance goes, there's SOME lag at points when I'm using the touchpad, but that's only when I have it set to low-performance mode when I'm trying to conserve battery. Otherwise the 6-core processor rips through all tasks with ease, and for my needs 8GB of RAM is more than enough, especially when coupled with a PCI Express SSD card.
-Keyboard is very easy to type on, I thought I'd be annoyed by the narrow numberpad on the right but it's surprisingly easy to get used to after using for a few days.
-Gaming is really smooth. It's odd to use a 15.6inch laptop when im coming from a 26inch monitor on my PC, but that's just me.
-Considering the guts of this machine and how powerful it actually is, I'm really pleased with the portability of it.

To comment on some of the negatives:
-When the GPU is under heavy load, the cooling fans can definitely get pretty loud, almost to a point of annoyance. I usually find that this is the case when I have a game running and the dedicated GPU is in use (I switch back to the Intel UHD630 integrated GPU when I'm not gaming).
-As far as battery life goes, yes, when you're using a ""gaming"" laptop, battery life is going to suffer. If you're playing a game at full settings, expect to get an hour and change. If you're browsing the internet at full brightness, using the dedicated GPU, & in performance mode, 3+ hours is realistic. I'm generally able to get 5-6 hours out of this battery by turning the brightness down to 20-30%, and turning low-performance mode on (click the battery icon in the system tray and move the slider to the left), which is more than enough for my use.
-I personally haven't felt any of the odd creaks/bends/noises that the machine makes when you open/close the lid. Maybe I got a better unit than other people or maybe I'm a bit more gentle with my expensive purchases, but I'm generally happy with my hardware. My only hardware gripe is the size of the bezels around the screen, but for under $1k I can deal with it.
-Yes it gets hot. It's a gaming laptop. It has a 6-core processor. It has a dedicated GPU. It's under an inch thin. What did you expect when running your AAA title at ""Ultra"" graphics settings for 2 hours on a laptop?

Side note - and having the ability to do this is a HUGE benefit in my eyes - I'm really happy that there's space in the chassis to add a 2nd hard drive, and the fact that the bottom of the case can be removed pretty easily. I've only had the computer for a month and change, probably a few more months down the line I'll be cracking the case open and adding a 2nd SSD and at least doubling the RAM to 16gigs.

All in all, totally worth it, and runs games like a champ when you need it to. Definitely would recommend!",George,Awesome,2,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"Overall, this is Dell G7 Laptop is pretty decent for its MSRP. It packs a powerful 6 core processor with a decent graphics card that can drive most if not all current games at 1080p. There are a few minor gripes here and there, but nothing major that would dismiss this laptop entirely. 

PROS:
-Laptop is built good enough. There is absolutely no flex in the keyboard area. The screen does feel a little flimsy since it's all plastic. 
-The fan is basically always off when doing light tasks like watching a movie or web browsing. This just means it'll run at a slightly warm temperature - CPU temperatures seems to stay just below 60 degrees Celsius. 
-Palm rest stays cool even after long gaming sessions. Same cannot be said for the right side of keyboard though.
-Power cable plug is on the left side. I can't even begin to explain how annoying it is when it's on the right side and interfering with my mouse. 

CONS:
-8 Gb of ram is quite a bummer. Right after startup and opening chrome, I'm already running near 5 Gb of ram. While it is two 4 Gb dimms meaning dual channel, it also means upgrading to 16 Gb would require you to purchase a whole 16 Gb stick instead of just one 8 Gb stick. 
-The included SSD is also nothing to brag about. A quick benchmark shows a sequential read and write of 469 MB/s | 213 MB/s. While seemingly ok, I have run into performance lag when windows does an antimalware scan. 
-The thermals when gaming get surprisingly hot. I see max temps of 100 degrees Celsius for the CPU and 85 degrees for the GPU after a couple hours of gaming. Intel specifications for the 8750H says max temperature is 100 degrees Celsius. Playing things a little risky here if you ask me.

USER EXPERIENCE:
As far as laptop user experience goes, I've definitely seen worse. There's only a few unwanted bloatware that come default (McAfee, handful of installed windows apps that takes up space). The included SSD is only 256 Gb, and it's quite limiting. I'm already down to half after installing a couple of games. If you do plan on using this laptop a bit, I'd suggest putting in a secondary hard drive. 
There also no much lag / freezes during normal usage (apart from when the scans run as mentioned above). It has run every game I've thrown at it, although this is more of a testament to the GTX 1060 than the laptop itself. 
The keyboard feels pretty good to type on. The keys itself are responsive and have a nice bouncy feeling to them. I didn't realize how much I disliked the keyboard turning off the backlight after a couple minutes of inactivity until it happened to me constantly. Another thing to notice is that there is a lock FN function on the ESC key. I had not realized this earlier and thought the FN functions weren't working. 
There are two front facing speakers that are good enough. They don't get very loud though, but at the same time they don't sound tinny. Putting the speakers there means more room for a larger touchpad. 

My final thoughts are that this a decent laptop with good upgradability. It has the specs to compete with the rest of the high end gaming laptops, while being modest with the price. With some ram upgrades and a secondary drive, there's no reason this can't be a high end workstation laptop at a fairly low price.",Leonardo,Excellent laptop with powerful specs,1,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"This is a great gaming laptop at a reasonable price point. I’ve used Dell laptops at the office for over 10 years and this is the first “gaming” laptop I’ve had a chance to use. As with all my previous Dell computers, the quality of the system from the build to the components are top-notch. This laptop performs well thanks to the newest 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of DDR4 RAM (6 Cores/12 Threads), a 6 GB DDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q graphics card and 256GB SSD with an expansion slot for an additional 2.5” HD/SSD.

It was easy to setup and get started. Windows 10 is pre-installed and I had it up and running within minutes. As this is a gaming-only laptop for me, I did not add many of my usual applications to this machine and have focused on using it for playing Fortnite and Overwatch. There have been no lag issues and the HD display really shines through. Keyboard is laid out well and includes a numeric keypad. Instead of the usual red graphics, Dell decided to go with blue backlighting on the keyboard and blue graphics on the lid and fan grills…pretty slick!

PROS:

- Well built machine from the build to components – Dell does not disappoint
- Fast booting with SSD drive
- Support most modern games at 1080p and on high settings
- Built in speakers sound great – headphone jack included
- Fast SSD drive with expansion slot for additional 2.5” drive
- Multiple USB 3.0 ports, HDMI port to connect to external displays or TVs
- Fans work well to keep machine cool while gaming or general use – not too loud either

CONS:

- System is a bit on the heavier side
- Boxy build, although this seems to be the new normal for gaming laptops
- Need to replace both RAM memory sticks if upgrading RAM

Overall this is a great gaming laptop at a great price point that will be suitable for all but the most discerning gamers. It’s well built and has all the latest components. This is certainly a laptop that I would recommend to friends and family.",mstanleynh,Great Gaming Laptop at Reasonable Price,1,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"The Dell G7 is an outstanding value in a gaming laptop. When you look at the features and specs, you would be hard pressed to find another gaming machine that matches this for the price.

To begin, the G7 is very well built. It is plastic (like 90% of the laptops out there) but feels very solid. It is a hefty machine. It's design is nice and clean, but nothing very flashy. The blue back lighting for the keyboard is probably it's flashiest feature. The keys themselves feel nice. 

The screen is very nice as well. I have seen a few reviews claiming the screen isn't bright enough. I really don't agree with that. I find it to be very bright with no hot spots. Color accuracy might be a slight issue for non-gaming use, but not a major issue. The Built in GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card is a powerhouse card. This is really the selling point for this laptop as far as gamers are concerned and it works great. Toss anything you want at it game wise at max settings and it can handle it. Will it be future proof a year from now? Who can tell, but my guess is you will be good to go graphics wise for two or three years. I also haven't found cooling fan noise to be anywhere near as loud as some other machines. Sure, you will hear it. But for a gaming laptop it's not that loud.

The battery life is ok for gaming, better for non gaming. Some might feel the battery is to small for gaming. However, who uses the battery when gaming? You buy a gaming laptop for moving around from place to place. But honestly, even with the most expensive gaming laptop out there you are more than likely still going to plug it in. 

The 8th gen i7 chip is amazing. Really, this thing is fast! Even though the laptop only has 8gb RAM out of the box, it is more than enough with the i7 chip. But what is probably my favorite thing about the G7 is how easy it will be to up grade memory. Far to may laptops these days have removed the ability to access the internals. Not the G7. Turn one screw and you have access to the memory and hard drive. In fact, it has an open 2.5 inch bay to add a hard drive right away. I installed a 250gb SSD in a matter of minutes. This alone is worth the price of admission for me!

The various ports can be seen in the specs list but it is safe to say you will be covered. I have already tried connecting it to my 29"" wide screen monitor and it looks fantastic! In fact, this will most likely be replacing my desktop machine.

Rarely does a product come along that I can't find a real flaw with, but this is one of them.

"I’ve never had a gaming computer before. I’ve always been “buy a computer that can play games from 5 years ago” guy. With this laptop, I went onto several “will this work” sites, and was shocked! ALL the games, including games that just barely released, were not only playable, but playable at high or ultra settings! Usually, I’d be playing on bare minimum requirements. Games like Doom or GTA would have lower resolution than a PlayStation One game. Now, all games are mine for the playing!

So far, I’ve mainly concentrated on two games... Sims 4 and my longtime guilty pleasure, GuildWars 2. Sims moves without choppy frame rates, and looks stunning. Guildwars 2 I’ve played since Beta on an old Windows 8 laptop with integrated graphics, on lowest settings. This laptop played it on ultra. The game looks totally different! Static trees and pixelated grasses have been replaced by wind rustled leaves and gently swaying grasses. I loaded a Doom demo and can’t wait to add that game to my collection! For the first time, I actually signed up for a Steam account! 

My next purchase will be a 2nd harddrive for the laptop to store games. I never realized modern games were all in the 60 to 90GB size!

Besides amazing graphics, this computer is insanely fast. Apps and programs load in seconds, and bootup time is around 8 to 10 seconds. It gets warm but heat is vented towards the back and never feels too hot. My only complaint is the AC plug. It only works in one plug in my house, and I have to jiggle it to charge when I plug it in at work. I’m not sure why it’s so picky.

"This is the first dedicated gaming computer I've owned, and it is like a whole new experience! Every single aspect of using it is better than any computer before. The quick and solid response from the keys, the backlit keyboard, the speed with which programs open, the graphics quality, the sleek case, the number of peripheral ports, and on, and on, and on. 

I am so impressed with it, that I don't even know where to begin. I suppose the keyboard is a good place, since that is the first interaction you have with it. The individual keys have a very low profile, smoothly beveled edges, and a stronger spring than I'm used to encountering on a laptop. This helps avoid accidental keystrokes and provides great positive feedback when a key is pressed. The adjustable backlight is a very soothing blue which allows for gameplay at night without washing out the screen.

It is engineered to maximize heat dissipation, as evidenced by how infrequently the fan kicks in, and when the fan does come on, it is exponentially quieter than any laptop fan I've heard before.

Graphics and speed are what you'd expect from the components used - crisp and fast - but it is the overall build quality that stays with you once you step away, and demands your attention each time you return.

Downside so far:

G7 is a really good entry-level gaming laptop, but DELL must understand that gamers like to upgrade memory by themselves using the most renown memory modules, not just with DELL parts (they are rather more expensive).

"This brand-new Acer Nitro 5 is a huge step forward from prior gaming laptops offered by Acer. It is a superb combination of technology and functionality which will outperform almost all existing laptops thanks to its incorporation of a new generation of Intel CPU and Nvidia graphic processing units.

Visually, the Nitro 5 is a stunning design with a beautiful slate black body containing subtle angles, beveled corners and elegant metallic red accents. The cover is not just slate in color, it also has a very fine texture which closely mimics a polished piece of slate. The keyboard has red backlighting and red type faces. It also comes with a very nice soft-sided black slipcase (with a red zipper) to protect it during transit. Overall, the impression is very sophisticated, high tech and definitely not a teen-ager’s gaming toy. This design would be just as much at home in a Goldman Sachs boardroom as in a college dorm.

So how does this laptop perform? In a word – fast! Make that two words – blazing fast!

I ran two well-regarded benchmark programs (Novabench and PC Mark 10) on three computers to determine their relative performance. These tests measure both the CPU (general processing) and the GPU (graphics processing) so they give a good overall result on the speed of a computer. The first was a base model desktop with an AMD A6 (A6-7310) CPU (comparable in speed to an Intel i3 CPU), no separate GPU and 8 GB RAM. The next was a nicely-equipped all-in-one computer with a 6th generation Intel i5 (6400T), Intel 530 GPU and 12 GB RAM. The last is the new Acer Nitro 5 with an 8th generation Intel i5 (8300H), Nvidia 1050Ti GPU and 8 GB RAM. All were well-maintained, running identical versions of Windows 10 with no other programs active. Here are the results (higher is faster):

Novabench Results:
Desktop A6: 636
All-in-One i5: 877 (38% faster than base)
Acer Nitro: 1997 (214% faster than base)

PC Mark 10 Results:
Desktop A6: 1451
All-in-One i5: 2372 (63% faster than base)
Acer Nitro: 4724 (226% faster than base)

In you go to the websites run by these two benchmarking services you will see that the results achieved by the new Acer Nitro 5 are faster than almost all prior generation Intel computers, including the i7 devices. How was this achieved? Primarily because the new Acer Nitro 5 incorporates the just-released 8th generation Intel i5 in a high-performance version (the “H” in 8300H), fast DDR4 RAM and the very fast Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU with 4 GB of dedicated graphics memory.

OK, that’s a lot of numbers and technical jargon but the bottom line is that you will find this laptop capable of out-performing anything you currently own (unless you have a really geeked-out special system) and very smooth in running any games or software you may ever buy. Put this nice laptop to work on most business software and it will never even break a sweat. Use it for photo or video editing and it will calmly do whatever you want, no drama. Fire up a graphics-intensive game and it will come alive, roaring with power and giving you the satisfaction that you made a great choice.

The Acer Nitro 5 includes some nice software but is not loaded with bloatware. Besides the full set of Windows 10 software and accessories it has Dolby Audio, X-Split Gamecaster, Cyberlink Photo Director and Power Director. A nice utility is NitroSense which brings up a graphic image of the cooling fans and gives you excellent control over them (see photo). As you use the laptop a program called Acer Collection builds up a set of recommendations for apps you may find interesting from the Windows Store.

Some may complain about the speakers but I found them adequate for most purposes. They are mounted at the bottom, have decent volume and good stereo separation – certainly good enough for watching Netflix or YouTube videos. It is fairly light – less than 6 pounds, nicely balanced with a great lighted keyboard and big touchpad, so those who like to literally use their laptop on their lap will be pleased.

What are the weak points of this laptop? 

Well, the battery life is marginal. I tested it by running Netflix on battery power with a bright screen and high speaker volume. From a full charge the laptop ran only 2.5 hours before exhausting the charge. So plan on taking the charging transformer with you! Speaking of the latter, it is pretty bulky, one of the biggest and heaviest laptop chargers that I have seen. I wish that Acer had added a second USB C port to use as a charging input (and other purposes.) 

It has an adequate 15.6” IPS LED-backlit display with 1920 x 1080 (full HD) resolution. Some might wish that it had a touch screen (I do!) as good as Acer’s beautiful Chromebook (which also has higher resolution modes). However, a touchscreen would probably add 15% to 20% to the very modest price of this laptop. And you always have the option of using the HDMI output to connect a big display. I hooked it up to my 65” 4K TV and it did a great job as a video source.

But these are fairly minor quibbles. When you consider all of its power and functionality you will agree that the price is a bargain.

"This laptop has honestly blown my expectations away. Build quality is very solid for the price, it feels like a premium item. The screen doesn't have much flex and the chasis feels sturdy during use (you can force a bit of flex, but it's not a problem). The hardware performs as expected and I don't really have many complaints. As far as laptops go, I'm coming off a 2012 MSI GE60, which was not a very good laptop. Let's get into a detailed breakdown:

Display

The display is arguably the weakest point of this laptop. Yes, it's an IPS panel, but this screen has extremely low coverage of the sRGB color space (professional reviews place it between 60-70% from what I've seen). Colors are noticeably washed out compared to even a budget dedicated monitor. Viewing angles are also very poor for an IPS panel, and are almost more in-line with a poor TN panel. The IPS panel feels more like a marketing bullet point, I would have preferred a quality TN panel if it could have been included for the same price. Ghosting is also pretty noticeable, but I've come to expect that from laptop screens. That said, input lag has been extremely low, so it feels great when gaming. The panel also gets bright enough for most environments. I wish it was a little bit brighter, but it's fine. I'd like to mention that by default there's an adaptive brightness that makes the situation much worse. You need to turn off the display power saving feature in the intel graphics drivers to fix this, which I highly recommend.

Keyboard and Touchpad

I've seen complaints about the keyboard in other reviews, and I don't really understand them. The keyboard is a highlight of this computer for me! I'm a fairly heavy handed typist and my primary keyboard is a mechanical with cherry mx blues. This keyboard requires less force than cherry mx blues, for reference. It's a fairly smooth keystroke with a noticeable actuation point and a satisfying bounce back. For a non-mechanical laptop keyboard, I'm impressed with how good it feels. It's also VERY quiet, which is a major plus. I've had no issues with the layout either. Now on to the touchpad. It's fine. It works. I personally like dedicated hardware buttons but the industry doesn't. Maybe it's just my skin texture, but my finger sticks a bit to the surface on this touchpad. That said, it seems to use windows precision drivers, which are great. The gestures are accurate and useful. Other than my fingers not gliding like I expect, I don't have much to complain about.

Cooling

This laptop has a decent cooling system. 2 fans, 2 heat pipes. That said, the heat pipe for the CPU crosses over the GPU as well. This affects CPU cooling performance and over long stretches of gaming or other intensive tasks, your CPU will get pretty hot. I haven't had it throttle yet and it generally stays under 90 C under pretty high load, but this is a concern. Over time as the thermal paste wears out and some dust builds up, heat might become a problem compared to other laptops. As for noise, the fans at full blast it can get pretty loud, but it's not a big deal and should be expected from laptop cooling. The tone of the noise itself isn't overly annoying, which is more important to me. You probably won't want to play an intensive game in a quiet public setting however. The air exhausts out the back of the laptop which is ideal. The operating surface of the laptop stays nice and cool.

Battery

I haven't tested out battery life personally (my needs don't generally require me to leave a charger behind), but it's a gaming laptop, don't expect any more than 4 hours doing basic web browsing. If battery life is a concern, you'll probably need to be looking at a higher price point.

Audio

The first thing you should do is uninstall the dolby software on this laptop. It automatically applies an equalizer and it sounds bad on all the presets. It will sound much better if you uninstall it entirely. After doing that, the audio quality is better than I expected, from both the speakers and the headphone jack. The speakers won't blow you away, but they are serviceable and sound pretty good in the highs and mids, and have a touch of bass to them. That said, any serious listening will require you to plug in some headphones, which brings me to the dac/amp. Audio quality is surprisingly decent, sounding good even through some Sennheiser HD 650s. Audio is fairly well balanced and my headphones are suitably powered even at about 20% volume in windows. There's no crackling or other anomalies, which is the experience I've had in the past with budget gaming laptops. It's audio quality I'd expect from a decent desktop motherboard, and that's a great thing! Doesn't match a dedicated dac/amp, but you should never expect that.

Hardware and Performance

There are other models of this laptop for less money, but GET THIS ONE. The i5 8300h is a substantial upgrade over the i5 7300hq. The i5 8300h outperforms even the last generation i7 7700hq! Compared to the last gen i5, it's about a 60% performance increase in multi-threaded work loads, and about a 20% improvement in single threaded workloads. This model also includes a 256 GB SSD, and an SSD should be considered a requirement for a computer in 2018. The 1050 TI 4 GB card, while fairly humble compared to the higher end offerings, will play any game you throw at it. I get a locked 60 fps at ultra 1080p in DOOM 2016 on this machine, which is fairly impressive. At the sale price of $730 (at the time of writing), this laptop is an absolute steal compared to the competition! All of that said, you should plan on picking up a 2.5"" HDD in the near future to install in the spare bay on this laptop (super easy to do!). Moving on to more secondary specs, the SSD in this laptop is mediocre. It's still way better than a hard drive, but this was a pretty safe corner to cut. The WIFI in the laptop has been great. In a speed test, I can get the internet speeds I pay for pretty reliably (500 mbps down, 50 up). I haven't had any dropouts at all, it's been a great experience so far.

Bloatware

There isn't much! Just uninstall Norton and the Dolby software and you're good to go. There's also some Acer utility software, but it's lightweight and useful so I personally left it. There's also the expected Microsoft Office, and some other apps you were probably gonna download anyway like Netflix. Nothing terribly intrusive and wasn't a big headache.

Conclusion

If you're in the market for the most affordable quality gaming laptop you can find or are just looking for a basic productivity machine (that doesn't require color work!) and want to do some gaming on the side, this is an absolute must buy at $730. At the full price, it might be worth considering some other options. I took off a star because the display is quite poor compared to the competition at this price range and the cooling system isn't adequate and falls short of the competition, while still being fairly acceptable, and I'd like to see these areas improved in the future.",John,"Fantastic laptop, for the sale price",7,1,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",4
"On the surface (no pun intended), the 2018 version of Acer’s Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop feels different. That would be, of course, due to the brushed aluminum lid, whereas most other manufacturers are still using 100% plastic cases. Mind you, the remainder of the case is plastic, but is quite sturdy…again, moreso than most other “budget” laptops. With the latest trend in LED backlit keyboards, Acer doesn’t disappoint. The entire keyboard has a pleasant red backlighting, while the W, A, S, & D keys have a heavy red outlining, thus making them stand out more than the remainder of the keyboard (a plus for gamers). Additionally, while somewhat smaller than a traditional “full size” keyboard, this is a full keyboard, complete with numeric keypad. Another nice feature…something more laptop manufacturers are starting to do…is the offset trackpad, which is slightly to the left, completely aligned with the spacebar. Unfortunately, the key’s travel distance leaves me wondering, as the keypress depth is on the shallow side. Another negative for the keyboard is the arraignment of certain keys, such as the placement of the “up” key to the immediate right of the right “shift” key, as well as the power button being placed in the upper right-hand corner (immediately to the right of the “End” key, and above the “-“ key). Turning the laptop over reveals easily-accessed covers for upgrading the RAM & storage (either HDD, or SSD). Overall, despite certain “design flaws”, the design is very nice, and doesn’t scream “this is a gaming laptop”.

The IPS display is an improvement over the original 2017 model (from what I understand, later 2017 models have the same LCD display as the 2018 model, but they will lack other upgrades, such as the 8th-Gen CPUs). The display does appear to be slightly brighter in the center area, when compared against the brightness of the edges, but, on the bright side (ok, pun intended, this time), not only can the display be calibrated, but one source I came across, Trusted Reviews, even offers a download of the calibrated color profile (https://ultrabookreview.com/color-profiles/Acer%20Nitro%205%20AN515-52%20FHD.icm). While not the brightest, or most accurate, display on the block, it will be more than adequate…and, for the price, you can’t go wrong.

Finally, getting to what this laptop is designed for…gaming…let me quickly cover the primary specs: CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage. The 2018 Nitro 5 comes with Intel’s 8th-Gen CPUs, in the case of this particular model, the Core i5-8300H, which is a Quad-Core 2.3GHz (up to 4.0GHz w/ Turbo) CPU with HyperThreading. In real-world performance, it can outperform Intel’s 7th-gen Core i7-7700HQ (2.3GHz, max 3.8GHz), and for a lower cost. While this configuration only comes with 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM, it can be upgraded to 32GB (only 1 of the 2 slots is populated…replace the single 8GB SODIMM with two 16GB SODIMMs). While I haven’t actually opened the case (yet), I’d assume, based on the fact that this configuration contains an M.2 SSD, the base configuration contains a physical HDD, and the “high-end” configuration contains M.2 SSD & HDD, that one can add an HDD or SSD, increasing storage capacity. Again, this is only an assumption, but a highly probable one. Switching over to the GPU, while the GTX 1050 is the “base” GPU in Nvidia’s ‘10’ series, remember that this is the “Ti” version, thus it performs considerably better. Upon checking some in-game framerates against a desktop running a 7th-Gen i7-7700HQ w/ GTX 1050 Ti, the 2018 Nitro 5 with “only” a Core i5 & 1050 Ti outperformed the i7 by a few FPS.

I can’t say much for sound quality, or battery life, but mostly because I connect to external speakers, and because I rarely use the battery (it’s used as more of a “desktop replacement”, and is rarely “mobile”).

FINAL VERDICT:
Sure, you can go spend well over $1K on a mid-range gaming laptop, or a few (or several) thousand on a high-end model, but most of us can’t afford that. Additionally, the great majority of “real gamers” prefer powerful desktops over laptops. For the rest of us…the “casual” gamers, who occasionally play more CPU/GPU demanding games, the Acer Nitro 5 will be an excellent choice. This laptop would be a finalist…and, quite possibly the winner…in a “Best Bang for the Buck” gaming laptop competition. In short, you can’t go wrong.

Nevertheless, the above review, be it positive, negative, or anywhere in-between, is a 100% honest review, and the price paid played absolutely no part in my review.",Panther68,A Great “Budget-Minded” Gaming Laptop,6,1,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"The Acer Nitro 5 has exceeded my expectations. Having a laptop this light and thin that can still crank out the FPS for 1080p gaming. 

This laptop doesn’t seem to have a problem playing games as long as you’re not looking for the highest graphic settings and fps beyond 60, which most people can be happy with.

Playing Fortnite and letting G-Force Experience optimize my game settings, I was getting 60fps at high graphical settings. I didn’t experience any stuttering or lag while playing. 

Playing Paragon, the optimal settings were set to medium which kept the game at 60fps and again, gameplay was smooth even as minions flooded the screen and a lot was happening. 

The laptop itself looks good to the eye. Hinge seems sturdy and opens easily enough that it doesn’t lift the laptop. Everything does kind of flex a bit if you try to make it with little effort, although you don’t get that sense from looking at it. The keyboard types really well, keys are spaced nicely and backlit red (sorry, no RGB). There doesn’t seem to be any weird layouts as far as where the keys are placed but Acer does use the Fn key for a lot of the hot keys you’d normally see specialized buttons for. The trackpad is a trackpad. The physical click is kind of stiff and requires a bit of effort. I pride myself on never using physical clicks on the trackpad anyways and typically stow away a mouse in my travel bag anyways.

Specs in this thing are pretty solid. There’s enough ram (8GB) to tackle everyday tasks with an open slot for future expansion. The SSD seems to be NVME which makes file transfers a breeze with 1554 MB/s reads and 586 MB/s writes with synthetic benchmarks. There’s also a slot for a SATA drive if you wanted to add storage for games (I’d take care if doing it yourself as the SATA connector is on a ribbon cable and they’re very fragile.) The CPU is pretty beastly for a laptop, coming in with a quad core i5-8300U it can turbo boost up to 4.00 GHz. Finally, the GeForce 1050 Ti. I wasn’t 100% sold on the capability of the 1050 Ti at first, but after playing a few games I was pleasantly surprised how well it performs. 

Now for a few of the cons. The fans do get a bit loud when cooling the laptop. The fan noise doesn’t personally bother me, but if you game in a public environment, this could bother others. The webcam is so-so, it checks a box but that’s about it. During setup my laptop came default with the trackpad off. Not knowing the Fn key off the bat, it took me a few to figure out how to get it back on. The chassis isn’t aluminum which is common in notebooks these days but for the price, I can understand the tradeoff. I/O has 1 usb c, 1 usb 3, and 2 usb 2.0. Not sure how much using usb 2.0 saved on this build but I would be surprised if it was a lot. 

I was extremely happy with the power and speed of this laptop. It’s ability to sit in the lap and work as a productivity machine without fatiguing my lap, then sit at the desk and crank out a few hours of gaming is fantastic.",TravisJ,"Affordable, Sleek Gaming Laptop that Games",3,1,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"I will start out this review by saying this laptop blew my expectations. Since this is on the cheaper end of gaming laptops I was expecting to notice that in performance or design.  

The design of this laptop is much different than other gaming laptops that exists. It is much thinner and lighter than others. It has some lines and the red black color scheme but other than that it is a lot closer to a regular laptop. It is also not as bulky and heavy. It still comes in at just under 6 pounds so it is hefty compared to some modern day ultra-books. Part of the reason that it is so cheap is because it is made out of a lot of plastic. The plastic can make it feel a little less premium but I still love its design. The keyboard has red backlighting which I am personally a fan of. In addition the WASD keys are outline with read so that they can easily be found during gaming. The keys are extremely quiet when typing and there is little feedback. After some time you get used to typing on it but a little more feedback and travel would be nice. One complaint is how close together the keys are. However, my biggest complaint about the keyboard is how all of the functions such as changing the volume or brightness require you to hold down the function key and then press each function. They do not have their own dedicated keys like on most laptops and they are spread out throughout the keyboard. I found it to be time consuming and a hassle to change any of these settings. I can normally type without looking at the keyboard but on this laptop every time I would hit the backspace key I kept hitting the number lock key on the 10 key. The track pad works decent but I would recommend getting a mouse to use while gaming or working on it. The screen is full HD and offers great colors. It is one of the better screens I have seen on a laptop. Another great thing about the screen is that it is anti-reflective which in my opinion makes a huge difference. As far as ports I wish that the two 2.0 USB ports were 3.0 but it does have one 3.0 and a Type C port. It is nice that it includes all of these ports because it is compatible with both old and new technology without needing a bunch of dongles. 

The next thing I would like to cover is upgradability. Every year newer, better, and faster technology comes out. A lot of laptops are getting to a point where everything is soldered onto the mother board. With as fast as technology becomes outdated it is important that you can update your laptop with new technology. It was an extreme surprise to me that there was room in the Hard drive bay to add an extra 2.5 in HDD or SDD for more storage. This was nice because it only has 256gbs of storage so it would be easy to throw in an extra drive for more storage. You can also easy access the memory where you can fit two sticks of DDR 4 laptop RAM. I also decided to dig deeper and pull off the entire bottom of the laptop. It comes off easily if you remove all the screws. This was extremely helpful especially if you wanted to clean out the dust on the inside of the laptop. From here I found the internal SSD. To my surprise it was an m.2 PCIe SSD. This means that it can be replaced with something like a Samsung EVO 960 SSD. This can be a fairly cheap upgrade to much faster and larger storage. So this laptop not only allows you to add a SATA drive but you can also replace the internal SSD because it is not soldered to the motherboard.  

Last and possibly most importantly is performance. This PC was built for gaming and in order to handle games the hardware must be very good. Although the internal components can be upgraded to better and faster ones, the components that it comes with performed amazingly. The new 8th generation Intel I5-8300H performed extremely well. I was a little weary about gaming on an i5 instead of i7 but it had no problem at all. In fact it is most likely faster than some i7s. The ram at 8gbs seemed to be enough although I will eventually upgrade to 16 and it can support up to 32! The SSD is one of the fastest that exists and the only downside of it is that its only 256 gbs but still plenty. The graphics card is also one of the better ones and came handy while gaming. It was able to handle Fortnite on Epic settings without any issues. One thing to think about while gaming is keeping your computer cool. This laptop has an awesome cooling system and great ventilation. Even after gaming for an hour or more on it I never really even heard the fans kick up to high. NitroSense is an awesome program that it comes pre-installed with that allows you to adjust the fan settings. There is no doubt that this laptop can handle any of today’s popular games with the hardware that it comes with. Last part of performance is battery life. It is not expected to have all day battery life as it is a gaming laptop but if you are on the go and not gaming you can get 4-5+ hours depending on your settings. For the power it has to offer I would not complain about the battery life.  

Overall I think this is a great laptop. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to get into gaming but is on a budget. Right out of the box it can handle games and down the road it would be very easy to upgrade the internals making it that much better. There are a couple flaws in the design but they are nothing major that should stop anyone from buying this laptop. I do not think there is any other laptop on the market in this price range that is performing this well. In addition to gaming it would be a great laptop for anyone needing a lot of processing power for business such as video or photo editing.  ",dlowen,BEST Entry level gaming laptop!!,2,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"The Hardware
The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53 notebook is based on Intel’s new 300-series notebook platform featuring Intel’s Coffee Lake Core i5 processors with four cores, an integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller, and built-in 2×2 802.11ac Wave 2 Wi-Fi support with the Intel Wireless-AC 9560 CRF module. The wireless module also supports Bluetooth 4.1. The system is equipped with 8 GB of DDR4 -2666 memory (Micron) and can be upgraded to 32GB. The hard drive is a 256GB Intel SSDPEKKW256G7 PCIe SSDs. There is an extra hard drive bay with the HD tray and extra screws needed to install one. I did have one quirk installing the extra drive I had to go into the bios and switch the boot drive to drive 1 (the internal) as the additional drive is designated drive 0 I already had windows on there from a previous computer and it booted to that drive instead. 

The AN515-53 upps the gaming performance in this version from both components with an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB GDDR5 and an Intel SSDPEKKW256G7 256GB SSD compared to the base model that has the Nvidia GTX 1050 and a 1 TB sata hard drive. Routine video is controlled by the Intel 630 while gaming uses the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti.

Screen
This laptop has a 15.6 inch matte 1920 x 1080, IPS LG Philips LGD0590 (LP156WF6-SPK6) screen. I found it bright and after I applied a calibration (icc) file https://ultrabookreview.com/color-profiles/Acer Nitro 5 AN515-52 FHD.icm the colors were accurate. This icc file works for the -52 and -53 variants with the Lg panel. 

Ports and Sound
 This laptop has one USB Type-C port, three USB Type-A connectors, a GbE port, an HDMI output and a SD card reader. The sound system of the Acer Nitro 5 is comprised of a headphone jack connector, stereo speakers as well as Acer TrueHarmony and Dolby Audio Premium software enhancements.

Webcam
The webcam is good quality, it also has 2 microphones. If you want HD video you will need to add an external webcam. 

Conclusion
I found the gaming performance was really good, I played Fortnite, Final Fantasy XV and Star Wars Battlefront. There was no noticeable lag and excellent response. The Fans on the laptop will get slightly loud as they rev up to keep the Nvidia 1050 Ti cool during game play. The new LG Philips LGD0590 (LP156WF6-SPK6) ips matte panel was bright and reproduced colors well after application of the icc file.

"The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-55G9 gaming laptop packs some good features inside it at a very good price, but also has some issues that hold it back. I fall on the side of recommending this laptop, barely. I will start with the features I liked. The Intel 8th generation CPU is very powerful and handled everything I threw at it very well. I expected nothing less. The GPU is also quality, and it is nice to see a nVIDIA 10 series dedicated graphics card at this price in a gaming laptop. Games, including VR games, worked very well with this unit. I also liked the look and feel of this laptop. Usually, gaming laptops have bright colors and shiny logos that mark them out as gaming rigs. This laptop has a matte black lid with a metallic black logo, and has a deep burgandy accent color. The lid felt very sturdy. The rest of the body felt like typical laptop plastic, but seemed durable enough. It booted up very quickly with a minimum of bloatware. I was impressed that it came with fan control software from Acer right out of the box. The keyboard was very typical, if maybe a little tight for larger hands, and the letters are backlit in red. The plate does come off of this unit very easily, which would allow for easy access to upgrade the laptop if desired. Now for some features that I did not like about this unit. It became very hot in a quick amount of time under normal conditions, and I am not certain why. It has 2 cooling fans, which were operating quite loudly, but they didn't seem to make an impact. This can be mitigated with a cooling pad to some degree, but it is something for which to be aware. I used a cooling pad after a little bit of usage, but the unit still became hot enough that I had to set it aside after about an hour. Another issue with the loud fans was that the speaker location toward the bottom of the unit became drowned out by the loud fan usage. Again, this could be mitigated with noise-cancelling headphones but is quite irritating if you don't use headphones often. The display looked very nice but was a bit dim even on high brightness settings. This would be OK in a dim environment but it was hard to see the screen when used outside. Finally, the battery lasted an unusually short time. Gaming laptops rarely have great battery usage due to the power-hungry components, so I took that into consideration. But even doing mundane tasks and internet surfing drained the batter in about 5 hours. Obviously, when gaming the battery drains even faster, about 90 minutes. In summary, this laptop has some great components inside and has an excellent price but as an experienced laptop gamer there were some serious issues to contend with, too. If you often game while using a cooling pad, headphones, and while plugged in, these issues might not be a big deal.

"Acer's new Nitro 5 gaming laptop is quite the speed demon, more than capable of doing almost anything you want to do with it, from gaming (naturally) to streaming music and video to routine stuff like web surfing and email. 
It is driven by Intel's new 8th generation Core i5 chip, a true quad core chip with Turboboost, which can automatically increase performance when its needed. Even better, this chip is hyperthreaded, which means it can mimic an 8 core chip. That considerable horespower, combined with a speedy 256 gig Intel SSD, 8 gigs of RAM and a built in nVidia GeForce video chip with 4 gigs of dedicated memory combine to make this a potent powerhouse,
I ran it through a series of tests and it never broke a sweat. Games were nice and smooth and some streaming applications that can be demanding, like Playstation Vue, loaded fast and ran perfectly. No lags or judders, common on laptops with less power. Nice!
The features dont end there. Another essential element is the speedy, dual-band MIMO AC wi-fi networking setup. There's also a pretty decent TrueHarmony sound system, which features stereo front firing speakers that sound better than most laptops I have used -- but can't provide the boom of larger external speakers. For connectivity, there's a decent mix of USB-A 2 and 3 ports along with one USB-C 3.1 port and HDMI out if you want to output to a bigger monitor or run a dual monitor setup.
The built in monitor , however, is pretty darn good. Full HD resolution means it's nice and sharp and color rendering is excellent. A matte finish on the screen cuts down on reflections.
Another handy plus is Acer's Nitrosense app, which allows you to easily monitor whats going on with the CPU and video chip, bump up the cooling power if they are getting too hot and set power and cooling schemes that best met your needs. 
Setup was dead simple, with Cortana talking you through the Windows 10 setup (first time I have seen that). You can respond by voice most of the time so hardly any keyboard input is required. The usual Windows and device driver updates -- required with any new PC -- were pretty quick. They took less than an hour and I had no issues. Boot up is a fast 15 seconds or so once fully configured, thanks mainly to the SSD. 
One other nice extra you don't get with most laptops: A padded custom neoprene, zip up case, good to have when traveling (just big enough for the laptop though, not the power brick). 
Overall, its a great laptop, but not without few flaws. For one thing, it seems like it is a lot bigger than it needs to be, with a very wide 1-inch bezel around the 15.6-inch screen. And while it's relatively thin, it weighs in at more than 5 pounds, not super light. Add in the rather large power brick and you might find it's not as easy to move around as you would like. 
But the biggest problem is the keyboard design. The dark red on black color scheme -- which seems to be required on all gaming laptops these days -- makes it difficult to see in normal room light. And it is all but invisible in low light if the backlight is off (it remains on all the time when on AC power but cuts off after a few seconds on battery power).
Worse yet is the key control layout, which leaves a lot to be desired. Too many key functions, like sound volume, must be control with multipurpose keys, using the function key and another key to accomplish the task. That two-handed approach is crazy on a gaming laptop. Worse, the mute control (also a two handed operation) is on the other side of the keyboard from the volume controls. Dumb. There should be dedicated sound volume and mute controls and they should be grouped together.
 The full-size chiclet keyboard fit my hands well but is bit mushy. The the multi-gesture touchpad works well but mouse navigation is still easier. 
Another personal gripe is a preloaded trial version (only 30 days) of Norton Anti-Virus. In my experience, these programs just bog everything down and generally are not needed -- never mind expensive. Windows 10 has pretty decent built in protection and if you want more, there are a variety of less cumbersome , free anti-virus programs out there. One of your first chores should be to uninstall Norton.",daytonadan,"Fast, great screen, but some keyboard flaws",1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",4

Unboxing the machine was a joy. Everything was packaged well. The exterior surface of its chassis, along with the sleek shape of this laptop, mirrors the appearance of many higher-end devices of this type. It looked like what it is - a gaming laptop.

This Acer Nitro Gaming Laptop looks amazing! It looks to be much more expensive than it is. The black and red color scheme - so cool! The keyboard is backlit red; even the touchpad is outlined in red. And for gamers, the WASD keys are highlighted. Fun times! Although I routinely use a peripheral keyboard and mouse with my laptops, I did find the backlit keypads on this Acer to be positioned well for comfortable typing or game play.

I really was excited to just start using this machine, and see what the in-game graphics were gonna look like. And so, I immediately set about installing World of Warcraft. Downloading the game did seem to go pretty fast, considering the size of the file, yet I was still able to surf the net and update Windows while the game was installing, with no problem.

Once I was in game, the beauty of this Acer Nitro 5’s Full HD 1080 graphics was there to behold. Watching the intro cinematic, which I’ve seen many times before, was a true pleasure. Details I’d not noticed before, shone through in bright, crisp, clear color. I didn’t notice any lag or sluggishness while playing the game, either. Always a good thing when it comes to gaming computers.

One feature I particularly wanted to mention was Acer NitroSense. This console allows you to monitor the laptop’s CPU/GPU temperatures, customize its power plan, and adjust the fan controls. But it is the CoolBlast Technology which really caught my attention. When engaged in extended, heavy gaming, you can turn CoolBlast On which will increase the maximum fan speed and thereby cool down the machine, decreasing its heat output.

A downside, or lacking, found in most of the computers I’ve owned, has always been the sound quality. But this Acer surprised me. I didn’t have to crank the volume up to its highest level 100, in order to simply hear the game. No exterior speakers were needed, at least for my purposes. The sounds of gaming effects, character’s voices, the music - was full, deep, and rich; even ambient sounds seemed more real and true.

Be aware, as with some other laptops produced these days, there is no DVD drive. However, the included zippered sleeve made to fit this size laptop, was an unexpected and much-appreciated bonus.

The instruction booklets were straightforward enough and simply following them as stated, was enough to get you up and running in a fairly short length of time. Even those who may not have much experience setting up a new computer, should have no trouble at all. Just let the machine do its thing, and make sure to take the time to get all those Windows updates done, and you’ll be good to go.

Overall, I was really quite impressed with not only the look of, but also more importantly, the performance of this Acer Nitro 5 laptop. And for the affordable cost of this machine, you’re assuredly getting your money’s worth. This brand is definitely one to consider when purchasing a home computer.",Janine,Pure Gaming Goodness,2,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"For those consumers who are looking for a budget minded, mid range gaming laptop, Acer is definitely in the race. This unit is marketed with a 256 GB SSD (Solid State Drive), but if you have a large collection of video games you may wish to swap out your SSD and install something a bit larger if you wish to download them onto your drive. 

For the average gamer, the Nitro 5 specifications should be more than enough to satisfy your gaming pleasures. If you are a hardcore gamer, this model laptop may not be powerful enough to enable a 4K resolution during game play, but please consider that you would have to spend significantly more money to achieve this. 

The Acer Nitro, has a keyboard that is backlit which is controlled (either on or off), by simultaneously pressing the F9 key and the Fn Key. You are unable to customize the brightness of your keyboard. When I tested this unit, I was sitting in my living room (which has lots of natural light pouring in through the windows) I found it a little difficult to read and distinguish the lettering on the keys (especially on the top row) when the backlight was in the off position. I would imagine this is because the color of the keyboard is black and the backlighting for the keys are red. The overall fee of the keyboard was nice, not to spongy and not to hard. I have uploaded several photographs so that you can see exactly how the ""lit"" keyboard lettering appears. There are two photographs of the lit keyboard, and one that shows the appearance of the keyboard in natural lighting.

The unit comes with a Webcam. so that you can Skype friends and family. The screen on the unit is matt (which tends to hide fingerprints as well as cuts down on glare), and the color definition is quite good and produces superior colors which are vivid. The built in speakers face downward, which for me was a little surprising. Sound production is usually hampered when not directly ""top"" mounted on a laptop. That being said, the overall sound was adequate and not collosal. If you enjoy concert level decibels, you would probably have to invest in a pair of external speakers. 

The Acer Nitro is a good gaming computer for the money. It comes with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 TI. Definitely not the ""ultimate"" with regards to specifications, but laptops fitted with a GTX 1070 or 1080 would perhaps would make the ultimate gamers a bit more happy with enhanced capabilities. 

Boot up time is amazingly fast, as this is my first experience with a solid state drive. The launching and opening of programs literally happens in a blink of an eye. You will immediately notice how fast this computer is.

In my opinion, the Acer Nitro is generally a good gaming machine for its price. If you don't mind sacrificing some graphics and some additional frames per second during game play, this unit is for you. If you are in the category of an average gamer (which I think fits most consumers), this laptop is for you. This unit makes my recommendation list and is sure to please the average gamers out there. Hope you enjoy you new device, as much as I am.

"I have had this laptop for a few weeks now, and I have to tell you, this computer is a great bang for the buck. Great overall, on all aspects, if you are a casual gamer. The battery life is really long. The weight is lighter than most gaming laptops (5.95 lbs), and the graphics card is quite impressive. When I opened up the laptop, and started windows for the 1st time, Cortana said it was starting up, and would take a few minutes, I thought someone was standing next to me. I was not expecting it to have me set up windows by speaking. I had to turn on the keyboard by hitting Fn F7, which seemed odd. Since the screen is not a touch screen, apparently Microsoft is really trying to force feed you to use Cortana, to see the benefits of it, right from the start.

I got a 256 Solid State Hard Drive, so it helps on the battery, retrieving data and also decreased failure rate. I noticed it is quieter than my other laptops that I have owned. For a few extra bucks, you can get a 1 TB of conventional drive in addition to the SS HD.

The keyboard is quiet, and trackpad is responsive. The trackpad has soft-like button pressing, to click, but for gaming, it is not so good. However, for gaming you would most likely be using an actual mouse, so it shouldn’t be an issue.

The keyboard is backlit red, which is pretty cool looking. I found that in a dark room, my eyes were not used to seeing the red, and almost made me look even harder at the actual key. The picture quality is pretty nice too. It is not the top of the line, but honestly unless I am playing a 4K video game, there is nothing to get caught up about. The contrast ratio is 1,114:1, and a Delta E of 5.18, which is middle of the line. The temperature of the color is at 7,028k, which is a little on the cooler side of coloring. But of course, all the settings can be modified to fit your taste. If you're looking for a 4K display and a GPU that can power it, you'll have to spend significantly more.

The keyboard DOES have the number pad, which is great, considering most 15” laptops can’t fit it in there. When I was not looking at the keyboard, I would mishit the arrow keys, and inadvertently press a 0 or shift when I wanted the arrows up/right. The up key is extremely close to the shift key, which there is practically no separation at all. Not sure why though. There are WASD keys that are red, so when playing a game, you can easily spot them, while playing. The touchpad does not have visible clickable left/right buttons. 

There are some pre-installed programs that are probably how they can keep the laptop at this lower price. If you are a gamer, you know how to uninstall things, so no reason to scoff at it. It just saved you money.

I’d say that if you are looking for a portable laptop that is not going to break the bank, able to play the games you want, great screen, fast and good graphics card, then you should take a close look at this laptop. I would have preferred it to have the Intel Core i7, but it would have cost more too.",Phjilek36,Good bang for you buck - If you are a casual gamer,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",4
"I do not know why I spent so much money on the whole Apple line of computers. I owned an MBP, mac mini, and now own an i7 MBA. I have always purchased PC's for work as much of the legal documents I work with are easier dealt with in PC. I am, however, in love with my Ipad Pro 10.5 --- the ultimate media consumption and e-mail checking tool aside from my smartphone.

I do believe that Apple's beautiful aluminum computers are works of art, but I think that since Steve Jobst passed away, the wow factor for Apple has definitely waned. And I think the PC world (and android!) has just about caught up in terms of functionality and definitely bang for buck.

Well to get to the point. I love the typing action and the screen as I have been installing my apps and accounts onto this unit.

The quickness with which websites and screens are loaded up are nothing like I have experienced before. I feel as if I was wasting my life away waiting before having bought this. Mind you, this is for just under $800, far below the cost of any apple computer with any serious processing power.

I convinced myself it was time as my religious group is going to start working on putting together a musical and I wanted to have a computer that I could use to work on music and audio production. I fancy that we will be doing multiple tracks, effects, maybe even some synths and VSTs and other processing intensive tasks.

I carefully considered the pros and cons of purchasing this unit at $729 versus the $649 version with the gtx 1050 (not ti) and the slower spinning harddrive (this one has the ssd).

I did not want to deal with the drama of having a slower and more delicate spinning harddrive as I have gotten used to working with ssd's in my laptops and desktops. I also did not mind having the slightly faster GTX 1050 TI. 

I am sure this is not the fastest thing out there, but it is the fastest computer that this tech-savvy penny pinching professional is going to have for some time... it is going to do wonders for my ever day computing needs for work and at the same time will be able to handle the creative work I do in the music world.

By the way, there is a crackling effect that I have been experiencing to the sound. I don't mind it for the moment, especially if updating the drivers makes it go away. I will keep an eye on it.

"I can sum this machine up with one word. Nice! There are a ton of great features on it and some of them are not evident until you look a bit closer. It is a gaming laptop and that being said, you won't find things like a touchscreen or a tablet mode. What you will find is an Intel CORE i5 processor, an NVIDIA Gforce GTX graphics card with 4GB of dedicated RAM, 8GB of DDR4 Memory (which uses less power and has much faster speeds), a 1080 full HD monitor with a wide viewing angle, backlit keyboard, wireless-AC, Bluetooth and incredible sound.

The build on this machine is really muscular and solid. It has a cool black with red trim design and a red backlit keyboard. It comes fully equipped with lots of I/O. Three USB ports plus a USB-C port, an HDMI port, uSD card reader and a headphone/microphone jack. It also has an RJ-45 network jack. The first thing I noticed about this laptop was how fast it is. I mean really quick bootup time and hard drive access. Which by the way is a 256GB solid state drive that really makes a difference in the speed department. It had no trouble at all with multiple apps running at the same time. The only game I've run so far is Diablo III. I set everything to the highest levels and it played smoothly without any glitch or stutter. Visually, the game looked phenomenal. Rich colors, sharp edges and deep shadows.

I also have to comment on the sound quality. It is truly amazing how good it sounds. Watching movies in virtual surround has incredible depth and sounds like it has a few more speakers than it actually does. It has Dolby Audio which has a six panel control and fine tuning app complete with a graphic equalizer. The monitor is clear and bright. It has a matte finish on it, this helps prevent any type of glare and also allows clear viewing from wide angles. I actually tend to prefer a glossy monitor because it seems to make everything look like liquid color, but I certainly see the advantage of the matte finish on a gaming laptop.

All in all, I'm really happy with this machine. Plenty of power, great graphics, lifelike sound, all the ports I could ever want and newest, fastest features of a solid state drive and DDR4 memory.

"The Acer Nitro 5, recently updated with the new i5-8300H, is an excellent gaming laptop that is competitively priced, yet does not sacrifice gaming performance. With 8 GB DDR4-2666 memory, a 1 TB hard drive, and an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 4 GB, it has plenty of horsepower to run all your favorite games. Furthermore, the Nitro 5 is able to pack all of this performance in an impressive sleek and stylish package that will sure to attract gamers.
 
Physically, the Nitro 5 screams quality. At fifteen inches, the Nitro 5 is the perfect size for gaming on the go. Dimension wise, the Nitro 5 is impressively thin at 1.05 inches and only 10.47 inches in depth. On the top of the laptop, there is a glossy brushed aluminum appearance that also encompasses the keyboard. It is enhanced further by the red backlit LED on the keyboard. Overall, the theme of the Nitro 5 looks stunning. Lastly, it shifts to a plastic finish on the sides of the laptop. Weight wise, the Nitro 5 feels considerably lighter than it looks despite Acer listing it at just under six pounds. Nonetheless, the Nitro 5 still has some weight to it but it is not excessive as with some gaming laptops. In addition to weight, you will also note the Nitro 5 has a relative large heat exhaust that is located directly underneath the display. The heat exhaust slit does not go all the way across the front, but instead stops about half way. Lastly, underneath the display, there is an engraved smooth red bar where the display pivots. Overall, it is definitely a stylish package.
 
For connectivity, the Nitro 5 offers plenty of options. On the right hand side, you will note two USB 2.0 ports, perfect for a gaming mouse or an external optical drive. There is also a combo 3.5mm jack that will work with either a microphone or headphones (there are two microphones built in to the top near the webcam). Connectively, on the left, there is one USB 3.0 Type- A port and one USB 3.1 Type-C (Gen 1). There is also an Ethernet RJ-45 connection and an SD card slot to fully complement your needs. Additionally, the power button for the laptop is actually a button on the keyboard as opposed to an actual button on the side. Lastly, there is one HDMI connection for an external monitor. Strangely, Acer did not include an LED for hard drive activity. Overall, the Nitro 5 has plenty of connections that should suit your needs. Naturally, I wish Acer would have somewhat remedied the 3.5mm combo jack by splitting it into two separate 3.5mm as some headsets have two analog connections. Although it isn't too much of an issue, as there are two microphones built into the Nitro 5, I cannot use my headset's microphone if I plug in the headphone portion of the 3.5mm and vice versa. Additionally, while some people may complain at the lack of the USB 3.0 Type-A ports, the good news is that with the 2.0 ports you can connect a mouse and/or use a USB gaming headset at the same time if using the integrated microphone proves to be an issue.
 
As configured, the Nitro 5 was one of the least cluttered laptops that I have used. The hard drive came as a single partition with approximately 30 GB used. Surprisingly, once you enter the windows environment the laptop was not starved of resources. The memory was around 20% used and the hard drive wasn't pegged by any particular executable (surprising as Norton Internet Security came bundled). However, the hard drive was fragmented pretty bad initially at 10%. Of the software that was installed, there were only four that were Acer branded installations. Lastly, Acer included Nitrosense, which allows you to control the fans for your CPU and GPU and monitor their temperatures.
 
For my gaming tests, I tried to keep my changes to a minimum to give you an idea on how the Nitro 5 performs directly out of the box. In particular, I defragmented the hard drive, changed the power options to high performance, prevented both the display and hard drive from going to sleep, and prevented OneDrive from starting up with Windows. Additionally, I disabled hibernation and ran all tests while connected to the wall adapter. Lastly, I did not update any drivers. For monitoring, I used HW Monitor 1.35, Core Temp 1.11, and Fraps 3.59. I set the Nitrosense fan setting to max (6000 RPM).
 
On Rise Of The Tomb Raider (2016), the opening sequence is an intensive test for any GPU. For my test, I set the preset to high, turned off V-Sync, and set the anti-aliasing to FXAA. I also turned off shadows, film grain, and motion blur. With these settings, the game was completely playable and looked stunning. Walking across the mountain, the frame rate varied from the low to middle 50s to upper 40s. Once the weather effects kicked in, I dropped to around 42-46 FPS. As the mountain gave way, I dropped to my lowest observed point at 41 FPS. Additionally, the frame rate quickly rebounded once you start climbing the ice. When you get it inside the cave, it increases to the low 50s. Exiting the cave, the weather effects pushed the frame rate down but it quickly rebounded once you emerge. I would like to strongly emphasize that you should tinker with all the settings as you may find certain combinations work better. Turning down some settings to medium may allow you to bump another to high, thus possibly improving your frame rate. Nonetheless, the Nitro 5 performs exceptionally. Furthermore, the GTX 1050 held consistently around 60 Celsius during the test. Switching gears, I fired up the latest Doom (2016) and wanted to test a fast paced multiplayer match. Surprisingly, Doom held a more consistent rate as oppose to Tomb Raider. I ran everything on High preset and enabled FXAA. I disabled film grain, player self shadow, and chromatic aberration. During my multiplayer match, the game play was extremely smooth. The FPS held consistently between 60-75 FPS, with the lowest dip touching 54 FPS. The in-game metric graphs displayed solid green bars and average FPS numbers were highlighted in green for majority of the match. Periodically, you will see periods where the in-game FPS counter would briefly turn yellow and red, however I did not experience any lag at all. Latency between frames remained green and I did not see anything greater than 13 milliseconds. Furthermore, disabling FXAA seemed to slightly increase the minimum FPS and seemed to steady the latency counter during intensive periods of action. Doom looked gorgeous and the Nitro 5 did not break a sweat! Conclusively, I strongly advise to keep your expectations reasonable. Do NOT expect to maximize every graphical setting for every game. You will need to experiment with different settings, but with what I have listed here, I have no doubt that most will be extremely satisfied.
 
In addition to gaming performance, I also wanted to test the multithread and single thread capabilities of the i5-8300H. With a listed base frequency of 2.3 GHz and a max turbo frequency of 4.0 GHz, I was extremely curious to see how it performs. For a multithreaded test, I ran a video encode of a 91 minute 1080p video file. Using Handbrake 1.1.0, I used the Fast 1080p30 preset. I changed the frame rate to match the source and I also removed chapters and subtitles. The audio was set to equal the source's DTS-MA 5.1 audio track. Once again, the fan was set to max. For comparison, I included my custom built computer's CPU. My results are as follows:

i5-8300H: 1 Hour 2 Minutes & 1 Second (35.5 FPS) 

i7- 3770K: 1 Hour 7 Minutes & 43 seconds (32.5 FPS)

Impressive! The Nitro 5 not only managed to beat my desktop, but was also within a respectable temperature range. During the encode, I noted the CPU package held fairly constant around 68 Celsius, though each of the cores did vary slightly. The cores would range anywhere from 55-69 Celsius, where Core #0 and #3 registered slightly cooler. For most of the encode, the i5-8300H was held under 70 Celsius, though a few cores did touch it briefly. HW Monitor and Core Temp reported the power consumption around 45 watts. With all four cores on full load, the i5-8300H's 4 core turbo frequency varied between 3.2-3.4 GHz. Simultaneously, my i7-3770K ran its encode at 3.9 GHz, but still lost to the slower the i5-8300H. 
 
For a single threaded test, I used MusicBee 2.4 to convert a 24 minute WAV file to MP3 using the Lame 3.99 encoder. I set the encoder to use a constant bit rate of 320 Kbps and the internal algorithm was set to 0 for high quality (-q command). Lastly, MusicBee's maximum number of threads for encoding was set to 1. I ran three instances on each CPU and added the i5-7500 desktop CPU to the mix: 
 
i5-8300H: 1 Minute 36 Seconds/1 Minute 36 Seconds/1 Minute 36 Seconds

I5-7500: 1 Minute 49 Seconds/1 Minute 47 Seconds/1 Minute 47 Seconds 

i7-3770K: 2 Minutes 6 Seconds/2 Minutes 6 Seconds/2 Minutes 6 Seconds

With the i5-8300H able to reach its maximum turbo frequency of 4.0 GHz, it is clear to see why it was able to edge out even the i5-7500. Additionally, my i7-3770K is starting to show its age, though is still respectable considering it is nearly six years old. The i5-8300H is definitely a workhorse! Concluding my benchmarks, I would like to include my results for 3D Mark Skydive benchmark using the basic version of 3D Mark. The results are as follows:

i5-8300H/GTX 1050 - Overall: 17,880/Graphics: 20,391 (93.04 FPS/93.19 FPS)/Physics: 10,502 

In conclusion, the Nitro 5 is a stylish combination of stellar performance and mobility. Furthermore, the Nitro 5 takes mobile gaming even further beyond expectations. The Nitro 5 dazzled with consistent temperatures, a clean Windows installation, a solid and sleek design, and a strong and efficient debut for the Coffee Lake i5-8300H. In addition, the GTX 1050 provided enough performance that should allow you to play games with a combination of medium and high settings. With an extremely competitive price, the Nitro 5 comes highly recommended!",Dragonhunter281,Nitro 5: Affordable Mobile Gaming!!,50,2,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",5
"======= Summary =======


The Acer Nitro 5 is a good budget gaming laptop that will satisfy casual gamers and those targeting a smaller budget. Many older games, and even some recent games such as Far Cry 5, run well on 1080P with Medium or High settings with smooth and consistent framerates. Performing everyday tasks such as web browsing, document editing, photo editing, and video playback is easily handled by the Nitro 5. Build quality is good for an all-plastic laptop. If you don't mind the weight (~6 lbs) and the thickness, I think the Nitro 5 is a great all-arounder laptop for everyday use plus some casual gaming.


** The Good **
-Good matte IPS display with vibrant colors and good viewing angle
-Accurate Touchpad with Precision Drivers
-Easy to type keyboard
-Pretty good stereo audio (with Dolby technology)
-1080P gaming is smooth
-Good port selection
-Upgradeable DDR4 memory
-Hard drives can be upgraded/added (one SATA and one M.2 NVME)

** Not So Good **
-Even though the plastic build is decent and okay, the lid scratches very easily. 
-The slow, traditional 7,500 RPM SATA hard drive is the weakest point and holds back the potential of the laptop.
-Limited keyboard lighting options.


======= Design =======

I like the black and red design of the Nitro 5. It is not gaudy nor too flamboyant. It has a ""gamer laptop"" look without going too overboard. It is not ""sexy"" like an Ultrabook with ultra-slim bezels, <1"" thickness, and <2.5 lb weight. But then the Nitro 5 is not catering to that crowd. It is catered toward casual gamers who want a good 1080P gaming experience with a discrete graphics card, extra cooling hardware and ventilation, and a nicely-sized and comfortable keyboard for gaming, all for less than $750. Toward that end, I believe Acer did a good job designing the Nitro 5. 

I only wish the lid was made of a more durable material. The faux brushed metal look is nice and smooth to the touch but the coating gets scratched up VERY easily. I already have several scratch marks and they won't buff out. If seeing scratches bothers you very much, I suggest putting on some sort of protective film like I did on mine. 


======= Connectivity =======

After being annoyed by my HP Spectre 13 laptop's lack of ports (it only has 3 USB Type-C/Thunderbolt ports), seeing all the available connectivity ports on the Nitro 5 has been so refreshing~! I love that it has an HDMI port, Gigabit Ethernet port, 3 USB-A ports, an SD card reader, and a USB Type-C port. For my needs, those ports are all I need and I'm satisfied that I don't need to use any dongles or adapters.


======= Keyboard and Touchpad =======

Thanks to the thickness of the laptop, the keyboard offers more travel distance compared to keys on an ultrabook. As a result, typing was easier, more comfortable, and more natural for me. Typing on the keyboard has a kind of ""soft"" feel but it was not mushy and annoying. I quickly adjusted to the keyboard and had no difficulty typing on it. Gaming on the keyboard was also good and did not hinder my gameplay at all. 

For those times I do some calculator work, I appreciated having the number pad area.

There is one thing about the keyboard that annoys me and it is not being able to keep the red backlighting on at all times. After a short time, the lights will go out and you have to press a key to make it light up again. I wish a BIOS update is coming in the future to fix this.

As for the Touchpad, I was thrilled to discover that despite using Elan hardware (which I'm not a fan of), the Touchpad uses Microsoft's excellent Precision Driver. I immediately went into Settings and set up all of my usual Gesture Shortcuts which made me very happy. Good job, Acer, for going with the Precision driver~!

I had no issues with the Touchpad at all and found it easy to use and customize to my liking.


======= Screen =======

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the 1080P IPS screen. I expected some light bleeding, grayish blacks, and muted colors based on the price of the Nitro 5. Instead, I experienced a screen that is sharp, crisp, vibrant, and with good viewing angles. The blacks are inky black and there is no light bleeding anywhere. Definitely impressed.

I played Rise of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5 at 1080P and the games looked great as well.

The screen is great for everything - documents, web browsing, multimedia, and games. 


======= Performance & Audio =======

Even though the Nitro 5 has an Intel Core i5 CPU, it is an 8th-generation Coffee Lake Core i5 with 4 physical cores with 8 threads mated with 8GB of DDR4 memory. As a result, the performance is great for both single-thread and multi-thread apps and games. Regular everyday tasks such as web browsing, document editing, and multimedia playback are all easily handled by the Nitro 5. 

Gaming is great too with the discrete GeForce GTX 1050 GPU. I played Rise of the Tomb Raider at 1080P with High settings and the game ran very well and smoothly with no severe framerate drops. To my big pleasant surprise, I was even able to play Far Cry 5 at good framerates at 1080P with Medium settings. 

Audio was surprisingly good as well with nice loud volume and clear stereo sound separation. 

The only thing that stood out like a sore thumb was the slow hard drive performance (I'm used to SSD hard drive speeds on my other PCs). Even though the SATA hard drive spins at 7,200 RPM and not 5,400 RPM, it still felt too slow. Longer Windows and application bootup times, longer game loading screens, and longer file transfer times. Fortunately, the default SATA hard drive can be upgraded to a faster SATA SSD hard drive, such as a Samsung 860 Evo. You also have an option to add an even faster NVME M.2 PCI Express drive if you're willing to remove the bottom laptop cover. 

Besides the slow hard drive performance, which can be remedied by an additional purchase, I'm satisfied and happy with the rest of the Nitro 5's performance characteristics.


======= Software =======

My software experience on the Nitro 5 is a good one. Windows 10 is fast, smooth, and reliable and the Nitro 5 came with an acceptable level of bloatware - 9 Acer apps, Norton Security, Netflix, a handful of games, and some Microsoft apps. They're all easy to remove.


======= Battery life =======

If you're not gaming on the Nitro 5 and you are doing other regular stuff, the laptop has decent stamina. For my usage, the laptop lasted between 5 to 6 hours (Chrome browser, YouTube, and document editing). When playing games such as Far Cry 5, however, the battery will quickly drain out in about 1 & 1/2 hours. For long gaming sessions, have the charger connected so the Nitro 5 doesn't hibernate suddenly. 

FYI, the battery seems easy to replace in the future. You do have to take off the bottom laptop cover but it's pretty easy to do so. 


======= Upgradeability =======

Coming from a soldered down ultrabook, the Nitro 5 offers a refreshing amount of upgrade choices - SATA HDD, NVME M.2 HDD, DDR4 RAM, and battery. I'll definitely be adding an NVME M.2 HDD in the near future.


======= So, is it any good? =======

For its $720 price, the Nitro 5 is a good value gaming laptop for casual gamers. The CPU is powerful, the memory is fast and upgradeable, and the GeForce GTX 1050 can handle 1080P gaming smoothly. The Dolby stereo speakers sound good, the keyboard is spacious and comfortable to use, the Touchpad with the Precision Driver is a pleasure, and the general performance is very good. Just do yourself a favor and upgrade to a SSD hard drive - SATA or NVME. And don't put stuff on top of the lid.",optimummind,Good budget gaming laptop,33,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",4

The Acer Nitro 5 is the budget-oriented series of gaming laptops from Acer. Depending on your budget, you can purchase one with an included SSD, Upgraded Memory, and a Core i7. The AN515-53-52 is the most affordable in the range. Included is a 15.6-inch IPS screen, Core i5 Coffee Lake processor, 1TB 5400rpm hard drive, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce 1050. All include plenty of ports from USB 2, USB 3, USB C, HDMI, and a stereo jack.

If this is your first look into a gaming laptop be prepared. After seeing all these ultra-thin and light laptops you will find the focus on gaming laptops is on performance before size. You can only squeeze so much power into the ultra-thin chassis. That said, the Nitro 5 isn’t overly heavy or large. At first glance, it is roughly the size and weight of traditional laptops of just a few years ago meaning it is still plenty portable. The top case is a dark grey/light black faux brushed metal panel which looks surprisingly understated compared to other gaming laptops. The logo is a standard Acer logo and the only hint this might be a different laptop is the strip of red on the hinge. Even once open the palm rest is a satin black finish, which attracts fingerprints, with black keys with red letters. The WASD keys and trackpad have a bolder outline of red. The backlight covers all the red accents except strangely the trackpad. The only options are on and off. Without the backlight on you could bring this to work and it would be unlikely anyone would realize it’s a gaming laptop. Overall it is a nice touch for those who want a system that can pull double duty.

This double duty continues onto the design of the keys of the keyboard. They are chicklet style keyboard that makes very little sound. This is helpful when you are in a quiet meeting but it does lend to a soft feel compared to Cherry MX or other mechanical switches. It might take some adjustment but if you can get over the feeling, the responsiveness and accuracy is quite good. Spacing is also very good allowing you to quickly find the precise key you want with good separation between keys. This does not carry over to the number pad on the right. The function keys at the top and the number pad keys are both very cramped. If you are playing games that make heavy use of the function keys or arrow keys, you might find a challenge to quickly choose the one you want. If you are one of those rare people who can game with a trackpad you will find yourself both happy and a little frustrated. The trackpad has the precision and responsiveness of a precision touchpad but unfortunately if you try to use that in combination with the WASD keys you will find they are nearly stack one on top of the other. Since most people use a separate mouse for gaming and typically for other uses the touchpad is best in the center this shouldn’t affect most and for other cases it works very well. Palm rejection could use a little refinement but is still very good.

Since this is a budget gaming laptop the big question is where is the big sacrifice? If you are looking at this system you already know the performance of the Geforce 1050. Older games are playable with all settings maxed out, but newer titles will likely take some tweaking to make them playable. The other slowdown comes in the form of the 5400 traditional hard drive and only 8GB memory. The good news is that both are upgradable via access panels on the bottom of the chassis. If you really want to risk voiding your warranty, there is also an M.2 slot underneath the bottom panel but unfortunately according to HWInfo64 there are no spare PCIExpress lanes available means an NVME SSD shouldn’t be compatible, but you can still use a SATA based SSD without a problem if you are up to the surgery. The system is compatible with Intel Optane RST but unfortunately since the wrong parts were used you can’t take advantage to speed up the slow hard drive on the cheap. With this slow hard drive you will find that system startup and of course games loads are slow. You will also find that with the 8GB of ram the hard drive gets easily get maxed out causing some frustrating lags. Yes, this can be fixed with upgrades later but be prepared for the occasional lag. Once things are loaded in memory usage is quick in most cases.

During testing with 3D bench the surprise was that the gaming bottleneck wasn’t the slow hard drive or limited RAM but it was actually the GeForce 1050. Processor based tests faired decent but during stress testing of the GPU the system was only to pull off 11FPS. This doesn’t mean the processor can’t potentially slow you down. During stress testing, even with fans configure to Max speed and even with CoolBoost enabled the Core i5 was able to get up as high as 197 degrees. According to the specs on the processor, the max temp is 200 degrees, so it came extremely close to thermal throttling even with all cooling settings used. The GPU ran cooler, but oddly the GPU the temps kept dropping off the monitor. The good thing is you want to run the fans at max speed to allow max cooling the sound should not bother you. The fans are most certainly audible but only as an air rushing sound. No bearing whine or other unpleasant sounds could be heard. This is quite impressive since some other high-end systems introduce a high-pitched bearing whine at full speed.

Continuing with the fan noise, the speakers are respectably loud on hard surfaces. Since they are downward firing any use on other surfaces will muffle the sound and make them far less useful. Combine that with the fan noise and a good set of gaming headphones are in order. Regardless, gaming headphones are the better way because of the distinct advantage of immersion and sound placement. The build in speakers seem more designed for casual use rather than gaming which is understandable for any portable gaming rig and more so in a budget one.

Battery life is always a sore point for gaming systems and the Nitro 5 is somewhere in the middle of the pack on this. Integrated Intel graphics mean that during light usage the GeForce goes to sleep and the system sips power but considering all that is crammed into the system you can get at best 5 to 5 ½ hours of light to moderate use. Gaming on battery power is expectedly much shorter and variable depending on the game.

The big question is if the AN515-53-52 is right for you. Gaming laptops push the edge of what can be done, and budget gaming laptops have a harder time since they must decide what to compromise to keep the price down. Although the Nitro 5 most certainly has compromises, it seems Acer did a good job of choose what to compromise to keep the price in check and made an overall good system with some upgrade options. If the Core i5 and GeForce 1050 do not meet your initial requirements, you are best off looking towards the higher end Nitro 5 from the start as those two components are not upgradeable. If you don’t need the most powerful gaming laptop available and just would like some modest upgrades while saving money this one could be for you.",CraigB,Decent gaming laptop for those on a tight budget,7,2,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",4
"Let's just say I'm not the master race type. I've had Playstation and Xbox consoles through the years, and my gaming ""roots"" take me back to the days of Atari and Nintendo (the latter, a majority of the time), and while my love for gaming has persisted through the years it's never been a top-5 hobby of mine. Just as much as the next guy, I'll wait for certain titles to hit and will buy them immediately on whichever console is my ""current"" at the time--Halo, Assassin's Creed, etc., but beyond that, I wouldn't call myself an avid gamer. And maybe because of that primarily, the notion of a budget gaming laptop was appealing to me.

But I'm not completely new to the PC gaming space; I recognize that the hardcore master race guys and gals out there are building their own machines with the best specs and saving serious dollars by rolling their own (versus buying something off the shelf called a ""gaming"" PC), and even more recently with more mini-PC cases being made in a way that makes home-building easy for novice DIY-ers, I've been watching (and waiting) for the right time to build my own. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies have pushed up PC internal prices in the last several months which has dropped this down a few spots on my ""to-do"" list.

And while building your own gaming PC has been the cheapest way into the game for some time now, there's still a temptation for the more mobile, more social among us to have access to a more compact way of taking gaming with us (man oh man do I miss LAN parties). Enter gaming laptops, which we've seen more and more of as time has gone on. 

This particular review is on the Acer Nitro 5, which hit the market somewhat officially several months ago but has been upgraded to Intel's 8th Generation Coffee Lake processors. A quick rundown of the specs here:
 • 1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive
 • Intel Core i5-8300 Processor
 • GTX 1050 Dedicated Graphics
 • 8GB DDR4 RAM
 • 15.6"" FHD IPS display
 • I/O: 3x USB Type A, 1x USB Type C, Full-size HDMI Out, Ethernet, SD Card Slot, Headphone Jack

Being that I'm not an avid gamer, I'm going to leave the benchmarking to the more in-depth reviews you will find all over the internet…what I'm most concerned about, as with any gadget, is the experience…especially in light of the specs above.

First and foremost--I had a few concerns about the spinning hard drive, but like it over the 256GB NVMe SSD option because of the storage required for a library of games. I recognize that external hard drives (and especially USB-C ones) exist and can alleviate this quite easily, but there's nothing more convenient than having access to more games without worrying about more attachments. From a performance perspective, aside from slower boot times and possibly slower game load times, the spinning hard drive did the job fine…but, if you wanted to buy an additional SSD and add it to this machine, you could do that pretty easily and with limited impact to your wallet. (Not that you want to buy a machine just to upgrade it, but that still puts you under $850 after upgrade).

And while the hard drive is a decision that you don't have to stick with long-term, choosing your graphics card is something that you have to decide up front. The Nitro 5 comes with either the 1050 or the 1050Ti, the latter being the better performer, but I found the 1050 to do an adequate job at processing video without stutter or lag. And, not that Rocket League is the most video-intensive game, it pushed 60FPS consistently without fail every time I played. Just upgrading to the model with the 1050 Ti and keeping the spinning hard drive adds only $30, so if you're looking to squeeze every bit of juice out of this it's almost certainly worth the investment.

RAM was another big concern of mine; fortunately, this is easily upgradable to a max of 32GB, but as with the lower-spec graphics card I didn't see any performance lags during gameplay running with only 8GB. And the display was good, not great. On a ""budget"" gaming machine, I wasn't expecting much here--decent viewing angles and got the job done; a 4K display would have too drastic an impact on price tag and performance, so there's not much here that is a surprise.

Stepping away from the specs, the design is one that I found to be pretty attractive and not too overstated. Gaming peripherals and PC cases and monitors and the various other gaming-related gadgets are usually far too gaudy for my liking, but the Nitro 5 does a good job balancing the traditional ""red"" gaming components with an almost stealthy look for the rest of the device. The keyboard was good, although I don't like the backlighting at all, as the backlights are more visible from the front of the device (with light bleeding out from beneath the keys) than it is on the keycaps themselves. I feel like this is a design flaw--making the keycaps just a bit taller can cover up these lines of light and add to the stealthy profile. The touchpad is fine (although a bit ""loose"" feeling to me) and uses Windows Precision drivers, although I would imagine most folks would be connecting an external mouse to this during long-term use.

Accessibility to the internals is no issue; the SATA drive and RAM are both accessible through their own ports and the back cover comes off pretty easily for those who want to upgrade (or in my case, ADD) an SSD. The device comes in at over 5 pounds, which is not unreasonable for a gaming machine, and is primarily plastic.

There are a couple final points to make in this review. First, the master race PC builder isn't going to waste their time reading a review like this, or even considering this purchase. But for someone like me, a not-so-serious gamer that wants to occasionally play some PC games, I think this machine is a really good choice. I think the intense gamers will probably be dissatisfied with something like this unless they're looking specifically for a mobile-friendly rig to complement their already awesome home-built PC.

Second, there is a fair amount of competition at this price point. I would fully expect a little bit of a discount for the entry-level, budget-conscious gaming laptop, so keep your eyes out for that. Specs will all be about the same, so it may come down to price or design that makes you pull the trigger.

Third, if you're not a gamer but plan to get serious about it, I wouldn't spend the money here. There's a lot of draw to having a gaming laptop, but in most cases, you're going to be playing in one place--and at $700, you can build a pretty great starter machine that will be far more customizable and upgradeable for you in the years to come.

But all that considered--I had a lot of fun with this machine. If a budget gaming laptop is on your shopping list, given that the Nitro 5 is available in a few different configurations (swapping out the spinning drive for an SSD or the GTX 1050 for a slightly-more-capable GTX 1050Ti), figure out where you think you'll get the best bang for your buck and go for it. I think the sweet spot is probably the better graphics card with the larger hard drive, but that's entirely subjective. 

Overall it's a decent machine that will provide some good entertainment for my family. I'm not a huge fan of the materials, but the design is solid and performance at the price point is good enough to get you started in the master race.",TheTechNugget,An OK starter budget gaming laptop,5,2,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",3
"Short Version:

This Acer Nitro AN515-53 is a good gaming laptop. If you are looking for a laptop to play games, this laptop is more than capable for the games of today.

Long Version:

I have had gaming computers for the last twenty years, but I’ve never owned a “gaming laptop” before. And there was a good reason for that; gaming laptops were too expensive and clunky to be worth the investment. So, it has been a pleasant surprise that this computer has worked as well as it has. In my time with it, I have played Overwatch, Doom (2016), Tomb Raider (2013), Total War: Warhammer 2, Fortnite, and Endless Legend. All have worked well. The game that struggled the most was Warhammer 2, but even my desktop computer struggles with that one. 

I also really like the look of this laptop. The keys are lit red, but in my experience, they were never too bright. The screen is great. It’s a bright, crisp 1080p. The machine boots up much quicker than I expected. The keyboard is responsive, and the sound system sounds great when everything is working as designed.

However, I did notice some bugs. Nothing to make me take a star off, but the audio drivers need some work. Occasionally I would get weird audio feedback with button presses. I checked on Acer’s site and with Windows Update, but the machine was running the best drivers out of the box. It seems to be related to the Dolby Sound System application, but I’m not entirely sure. Either way, it usually cleared up quickly and seemed more noticeable after the machine had first been turned on.

Thankfully there aren’t too many unnecessary programs on this laptop but I didn’t need the annoying Acer App giving me other app recommendations. Nor did I want a Norton Security Suite that was just going to be expiring in 30 days. Both of those were quickly removed, but the other Acer Programs were very useful. Through the Acer Software Suite, you can check on the integrity of the hard drive and battery as well as optimize the hard drive and check for necessary driver updates.

Upgrades:

The laptop provides easy access to the hard drive storage bay and the RAM storage bay. Currently, there is one 8GB DDR4-2400 PC4-19200 260-Pin SODIMM installed. There is a free bank where you can easily install another. In fact, with 8GB DDR4 sticks running around $89 to $100, that may be my first upgrade. The hard drive can be switched out for a slightly larger model or an SSD, but keep in mind that the hard drive will need to fit inside the included mounting hardware. If the drive is too thick (think a 3 or 4gb 2.5 hard drive), it probably won’t fit.

Conclusion:

I really enjoyed this laptop. If you are looking for a new gaming laptop, I don’t think you will regret picking one of these up.",RedScorpion,Surprisingly Good Gaming Laptop,2,1,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",5
"The Acer Nitro 5 is an impressive laptop. It has the looks and design of a gaming laptop, with specs that help it hold up that end of the bargain, but in a package that's a lot more useful. Let me explain:

Out of the box, you get this two-tone 15.6 inch laptop. My initial thoughts, this looks pretty cool, is going to have a great wide screen and ugg, be heavy. To my surprise, only 2 of those 3 assumptions was true. Yes, the laptop looks good. Yes, it has a great wide screen, but no, it is not heavy at all. At 4.85lbs, it weighs more on paper (and I'll reluctantly concede, in real life) than one of my ultraportable laptops with detachable keyboard, but the material and weight distribution of the Nitro 5 makes it feel like a machine half that weight. The weight distribution certainly makes an impact but they managed to accomplish the looks using what feels like plastic, rather than a magnesium (or some other high tech metal) body while still making the thing look good. Ultimately, this results in a good bottom line which price conscious buyers will appreciate.

First up after the windows 10 setup process was launching a few videos to test out the screen and speakers. The screen is great. In fact, I initially ran into the same problem I have when using devices with great screens for the first time - I watch a 1080p HD quality video, then everything else looks muted by result for some time while I get used to the device. Between short videos, TV shows, and a streaming movie, I satisfied myself that the 15.6"" screen made for a good viewing experience. Screen resolution, despite having a discrete graphics card, tops out at 1920x1080 so the PPI can't be that high, still, this someone combines for a great viewing experience.

The keyboard is full sized, if a bit on the large side due to the spacing of the keys. There was a slight learning curve to typing on this laptop, despite the fact that I use a full size standalone keyboard for daily work. The WASD keys are highlighted, a pretty big giveaway of the laptop's gaming intent which I felt was a pretty nice tough. The keys are LED backlit, though the jury is still out whether or not I fully like the way it was done. The trackpad is pretty nice and responsive. Instead of being centered on the laptop, it is offset to the left, but I didn't experience anything negative as a result. In fact, I pretty much forgot about it until looking at the laptop again while writing this review.

Gaming wise, the laptop holds up for some entry to mid level titles. Doom 2016 for example plays pretty well. Graphics are great and was the first time I noticed or heard any fan activity on the laptop - for anything else, it's incredibly quiet. Initial loading of the game was definitely taxing for the CPU, game play was handled pretty well by the GTX 1050. One couldn't manage the highest frame rates on very intense gaming, but I think there's a broad range of FPS, racing, and other games which will run pretty well on the laptop with a great experience.

Battery life was another item that took a hit while gaming. I didn't notice any real performance difference on and off battery, but the battery does run down much faster gaming versus watching HD streaming video over the same time period.

To watch the video I connected to my home wifi network and I paired a bluetooth mouse to play some games, both of these connections were made quickly without any issues, so peripheral wise, things are great. It has provisions for an ethernet connection for gamers who need absolute low latency connectivity.

In short, I'm pretty happy with the Nitro 5. I'll admit, I prejudged the package and ended up with a pleasant surprise. This gets 4 stars from me for the good all around package of looks, weight distribution, performance, and price.",zboot,Good All Around Budget Gaming Laptop,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",4
"I've been working on PC's for a lot of years, repairing them, building gaming rigs etc. I'm usually very weary about gaming laptops since so much can go wrong with one in such a small package, or design. But I've been using Acer products (mainly desktops) for 20 years, and they are super durable, and seem to last forever. Even the 9 and 8 year old laptops I still have, I don't use them much but they still work like a charm when turned on.

In this laptop here are the pros and cons imo. Mine was a birthday gift, but I just didn't feel it was needed, being that I already own every gaming console, and a gaming PC i rarely used. But thought I would try this anyway. And with the 1050 for this price that's not to bad at all.
Pros.
- The 1050 is good, for basic 1080p gaming, which most still want. The TI is not a huge leap, but a little better I suppose.
- Nice build, not overly gaudy or flashy
- Very light for it's size, some complained about the build feeling plastic(y), but I thought it was just fine.
- Keys lighting up red is a cool feature, though it can't be turned off.
- Screen is decent, just bright enough.
- Decent webcam

Cons
- This particular I5 is not the quicker of the bunch for sure, good for games, as long as they aren't super demanding.
- Fan isn't overly loud, but still subtley annoying under heavy load.
- Keyboard has a squishy feel, not very clicky, but still responsive.
- Trackpad is good but not very accurate.
- Games seem to play good for a while, but really start to lag after play for over 30 minutes or so. Not sure why this is, but it's the main reason I took it back. Even after updating the drivers. No sale.

Other than that it's a great machine for the price you pay. No it's not going to win any awards for originality in the looks department or run games at the highest framerates or resolutions. But it is what it is, a good, competent gaming laptop for those who want to play ""some"" modern games on the go. I still LOVE Acer, but I'm just really not a mobile gamer anymore. But I would recommend it to people who are.",Jerm,"Good Budget Gaming Laptop, Not Great",1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",3
"This is my very first go at a pure gaming laptop. I always had gaming desktop but never tried a laptop version before...

First things first... being a gaming laptop, it is noticeably thicker than the new standards of laptop. At 1.1"", it's still portable, but you can definitely see/feel the difference. Performance is very good, as I have used it to play Fortnite, PUBG and DOTA 2. The Matte finish is a plus since I am a fan of it (Less glare). With 8GB DDR4 installed (Max 32GB) and a 1TB 7200RPM HD, I would recommend upgrading to a SSD and minimum of 16GB DDR4 for optimum performance for GPU hungry gaming. The upgrades where easy to install since there are dedicated slot openings on the bottom of the laptop. 

Overall, for my first gaming laptop... having the ability to take gaming mobility is a plus for my travels. The added HDMI port makings gaming over a 4K/HDTV a breeze. For the price, this is a great buy at an entry level gaming laptop.

"OMG! How is deal possible? I am super stoked to have found this gaming notebook from Best Buy due to the recommendations from my friends. AT $719.99, it’s a steal. OMG, at $649, even my UK classmate also bought one that he will take home with him after this summer..

A friend told me that this system is Optane ready. Not willing to cough up the money for a large SSD, I went and purchased a 16GB Optane from Amazon (sorry Best Buy). The installation is straightforward on the Optane memory side (I cheated and re-used one of the screws on the HDD for the M.2 because my Optane didn’t come with a screw). I downloaded the Optane driver directly from Intel, uninstall the existing Intel RST App in my Nitro 5, and install the driver/App that I got from intel, reboot, open the new Intel RST app, enable Optane, reboot, than BAM! I likey A LOT! I am not sure if you can use the existing Intel RST app (I didn’t try).

I mean, yes, if I have money, I would rather have some crazy fast PCIe NVMe SSD’s with 512GB. I am super happy with this system as is. And, I am even happier with Optane in this entry gaming notebook.

Just FYI, I’ve made this purchase after reading many of the reviews, combined with recommendations from my friends. There was one review that said that Optane doesn’t work. Which did get me worried a bit before the purchase.

Love WoW, LoL, Warframe, Destiny 2, Overwatch, and now PUBG (luv/hate). This system handles them with great FPS.

"This has to be the best gaming laptop for the price in a while and even rivals those that cost 2x the price. First off, I got this laptop on sale during Memorial Day week at $1,040.99. I was looking for a laptop specifically with the GTX 1060 GPU and behold, Dell knocks it out of the park with this bad boy.

== PROs ==
-1060 6GB VRAM Max Q Design is an absolute beast. Played games like DOOM (2016), Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Gears of War 4, The Division ALL on Ultra Settings. I was averaging 60-95 Frames Per Second during massive action scenes! Mind you, I played each game at least 2 hours straight and the laptop kept cool between 69-71 Celsius! So, short answer is yes, this thing can tackle gaming at 1080p 60fps no problem. I haven't tried gaming at 4K 30FPS, but based on benchmarks provided via YouTube, as long as the game is well optimized, you should be able to play at 4K at playable frame rates on Medium settings which is also amazing.

-Overclocking the refresh rate (AUO63ED Panels ONLY). I was lucky enough to get one of these panels. Unfortunately, I cannot find any information on how to determine this unless you verify internally. Anyhow, I was able to overclock up to 96Hz without any issues. You can go up to 100Hz, but I haven't been able to try it out myself just yet. Either way, playing at frame rates higher than 60FPS is a beautiful thing to see.

-Thunderbolt 3 port for future eGPU (External Graphics Card) is awesome once the 1060 starts to age, but should be able to play games very well until the next 3-4 years depending on how resource intensive video games get. I wouldn't be surprised though if this card defeats the next iteration of both Sony's and Microsoft's consoles.

-128SSD+1TB HDD 5400 RPM, really great how they added an SSD and 1TB of hard drive space compared to the other version of this laptop

-16GB of DDR4 RAM, once again, amazing that they were able to give this at this price range

-Build design, the black chassis and the blue accent looks great. The laptop itself is about 5lbs so it's got some decent weight, but not your typical heavy gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Helios 300. It's pretty thin but not macbook air thin. This is a great gaming laptop without looking like one which is a HUGE plus to me.

-The Screen itself is a 1080p IPS Panel. Looks great, but you could tell that they had to make some compromises to keep budget friendly. Although this can be taken as a con, I'm not. It doesn't have the best representation of colors, but like I said, it gets the job done and games look good on it.

== CONS ==

-Wish the bezels on the screen were smaller, but its not bothersome nor will it drive you insane unless you are very picky 

-Speakers aren't that great, but yet again I play primarily with headphones so it doesn't really affect me as a buyer. It's decent, but won't blow you away for sure.


As you can see, the PROs definitely outweigh the CONs. I couldn't be happier and it's great that gaming laptops are getting more powerful, thinner and most of all, being more budget friendly.",branberrycakes,HUGE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK,22,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 128GB Solid State Drive + 1TB Hard Drive - Licorice Black",5
"Overall, this laptop is a very nice laptop for gaming (I bought it for college too as I will use it in modelling/CAD). It only gets loud under load, it only gets hot under load. and it has a ton of power. An i7 8750h and 1060 Max-Q is all you need to run modern games at high settings.

Pros
- Perfect balance of weight and durability. I feel confident holding this laptop (6 pounds)
- 15.6 inches is great for portability
- It's much quieter compared to other gaming laptops
- Very smooth display! (Hopefully you get lucky and acquire the AUO63ED panel like I did, which is overclock-able to ~90-100hz!)
- Keyboard lighting is blue!!!
- USB ports are fast, and there's a thunderbolt 3 that supports 4 lane-PCIE
- Touchpad is smooth and accurate
- Keyboard has a full numpad
- The front of it has nice blue accented cooling pipes inside
- Easy access to interior parts with just one screw! (Holy moly, other manufacturers, pay attention!)
- 128gb SSD boots up Windows fast, just make sure you download all other things to the hard drive.
- The i7 8750h is a monster CPU. This thing can handle so many tasks at once it's ridiculous. I was downloading 3 games on 3 different platforms and able to play Rocket League smoothly at the same time.

Cons
- Big bezels for the display
- Display isn't very color accurate
- Backlighting for keys is very low, and there's only 3 settings for them
- I had to make sure the 1060 Max-Q was being used in most applications that don't specify otherwise. (The laptop tried using the integrated graphics)
- There is no num-lock lighting indication (there's one for caps lock)
- Arrow keys are squeezed together and small

I was being very nit-picky for the cons. This laptop is amazing! If you need power for tasks, games on the side, and are on a budget of ~$1,200 then you need to buy this!",Lucas,So much power!,25,4,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 128GB Solid State Drive + 1TB Hard Drive - Licorice Black",5
"Shopped around for months looking for a laptop to replace my Macbook Pro. The keyboard and general sluggishness of MacOS ruled out any computers from Apple. I look at the Surface Book 2 (owned a Surface Pro 4 for a while and loved it) but the price kept me away. I purchased an HP Spectre x360 but constant fan noise and horrible trackpad kept me hunting. I saw the low-key announcement for Dell's G-Series gaming laptops and was intrigued. When I saw it on sale Memorial Day weekend, I couldn't resist. For the price, this is an amazing value. 

Pros
+ Amazing performance
+ RAM and both disk drives are user-upgradable
+ Number keys on keyboard
+ Ports!!! 3 USB A, 1 USB C, and HDMI
+ Windows Precision Drivers for trackpad
+ Matte screen (little glare in sunlight/bright lights)

Cons
- Screen quality isn't as good as compared to Macbook, Surface, etc. It's not bad in my opinion but is definitely lower grade than some competitors. 
- Bezels (really Dell? really?)
- Occasionally the fans will get really loud. I think it's McAfee or some other program staring in the background. The noise only lasts for 30 seconds or so. Not a big deal but occasionally annoying.
- Weight. Coming from a 13"" Macbook Pro, this weighs over 2 pounds more. It's noticeable if your coming from a smaller laptop.

I've played a few games (definitely be plugged in when gaming!) and am impressed with the GTX 1060. I have a GTX 1070 in my desktop so I have a comparison data point. Getting 70+ fps in Subnautica. Haven't tried my Oculus Rift yet but it should handle it without issue. 

If you're looking for a high-performance machine for a great price, get this. Sure you can get a better laptop but you'll pay for it. The comparable Alienware is several hundred dollars (based on when I compared prices mid-May) and doesn't seem to have any benefit other than a slightly better screen and an alien logo. If you're on the fence, go for it.

"I've been a console gamer for years, but due to recent life changes (for the better!), my console game time is GONE! I've been trying to figure out a good way to still play all the new games I want. I thought about getting a Switch, but the third-party support for that isn't all that impressive and the screen in portable mode is 6"" which might be ok, but thinking about games like Diablo or Borderlands on a screen the same size as my infotainment system in my car sounded like it could be rough. I was originally thinking I would just give it up, but then I read some other articles and sites that convinced me that a gaming laptop might be exactly what I need, and it is!

Reviews have talked about how heavy the laptop is and how dim the screen is, but I'm mainly hooking the laptop to a TV and playing with an XBOX controller, so neither of those are concerns for me! I was frustrated at first because I tried running a game on it and it ran terribly, but it turns out the reason was because it was still trying to use the onboard graphics instead of the dedicated graphics card. I read an article that explained how to select what adapter is used for gaming in Windows 10, and once making that change, I was quite happy!

I only have 2 gripes, but they're both to be expected by not buying one of the higher end laptops:

1) I benchmarked WWE 2K19 and was getting between 45-55 FPS. Still playable, but there was noticeable lag. Side note: Benchmark means push the system as hard as possible and see how it does. In this case, it was a 6 man tag match with all graphics settings set to max. Fortunately, in my actual playing, there's never any lag, and about the only difference is that I only have maybe 4 people on screen at once. 

2) The screen is only 1080P. I was thinking it'd be cool to have 4K so I can see if I really want to invest in it for my TV.. Side note: Keep in mind what you're playing your laptop on if you connect it to a TV like I usually do. I had the game settings maxed out but this is in my office with a 720P TV, so there's no sense in using maxed out settings. When playing on the laptop itself though, then I do all maxed out.",bandit7319,Great gaming laptop for casual gamers!,1,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 128GB Solid State Drive + 1TB Hard Drive - Licorice Black",5
"I LOVE this laptop. My favorite features: 10-key pad, ice blue accents, fresh off the manufacturing Intel 8th gen chip with Hex Drive, backlit keyboard, vivid anti-glare screen, sleek black color, SSD + 1 TB HDD, GeForce GTX 1060.

I spoke to DELL tech support (which by the way hung up on me after they could not solve my problem) and read a lot of comments online, this model is not compatible with most memory cards with performance. The only RAM compatible with this model is DELL which costs a ton of money and Crucial which is out of stock. Also for the SSD or if you're trying to add an SSD into an empty slot, you will have major problems booting up the laptop and it will get stuck on DELL logo when booting up after SSD install.

Another thing I've noticed that I am partially concerned about is the small connector for the screen to the laptop itself.

First and foremost: I am not a heavy gamer. I play Sims 4, but beyond that, I don't do a lot of graphic-heavy games. That being said, the graphics on Sims 4 are better on this computer than any other computer I've played it on, and I didn't have any problems with speed in loading the game or playing it. My usual computer is a small Dell touch screen, so the first time I used this computer, I was overwhelmed by the size and weight of the computer - it is several inches bigger than my tiny Dell, and probably weighs 3x as much. This is definitely a solid laptop! My BIGGEST complaint about this computer is that while doing pretty much anything beyond word processing, the computer gets really, really hot, which is concerning since it is supposed to be a gaming computer!

"This Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop is a pretty good setup for it's price point. Just remember this is not a high end gaming machine and set your expectations correctly and you will not be disappointed with buying this machine.

One of the great things about this laptop is the 8th generation Core i5 quad-core CPU. The 8th gen Intel CPU's are really a step above the previous generations. It makes doing every day tasks such as web surfing, office work, etc a breeze and the responsiveness of the Nitro 5 while performing these tasks is excellent. 

I am, however, confused by one thing. The item description at the Best Buy website lists 2GB of DDR5 video memory but the sticker on the box the laptop came in lists 4GB. Either way graphics performance on this machine is much better than I was expecting it to be. GTA V was able to be played at 1080p with high settings with no noticeable lag or screen jagginess which is a win. The built in display is fairly pleasing when gaming, viewing photos, or watching videos.

Battery life has been about as expected with me averaging between 5 and 6 hours doing the typical kind of daily stuff. Gaming will kill this battery in less than two hours so keep the charger plugged in if at all possible when playing games.

The build quality was better than I had anticipated it being for a gaming laptop in this price range. While it is all plastic it has a good feel in the hand and I didn't really notice any ""flex"" when handling it. When it's not in use I just slip it into the included sleeve.

"The Acer Nitro provides a lot of bang for the buck. 

The only drawback is the lack of a touchscreen or high-end graphics card. However, sacrifices had to be made at this price point. At the end of the day, the Nitro is a solid gaming platform. The resolution and image are good. The graphics card, while not a premium card, is good enough for the vast majority of games. The processor is quick. The memory is acceptable, although 16GB would have been nice and not much more expensive. 

Those are not really complaints, though. If the computer had cost over a thousand dollars, they would be complaints. But as is, those are just wish-list type items. 

The processor is plenty good to handle all but the most demanding games. It hasn't stuttered at all with anything I've thrown at it. Of course, just know that frame rate will drop with the really heavy stuff, but I haven't had anything crash on me. 

The red accent keyboard back-lighting and red accents on the spine look good. The keyboard is pretty decent for a laptop. I recall reading a review that criticized the font on the keyboard as being too thin; either the keyboard has been updated or that reviewer is a little off. The font is clear and legible.

My son was ecstatic to see a solid gaming rig in the stable. Acer made me a hero. For that, I thank them!",mikeheel,A Lot of Bang For The Buck,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",5
"If you're in the market for an entry level gaming PC, this is an OK choice. As far as specs, the only thing that separates this gaming PC from a regular PC is the video card. The 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive are fairly standard for all PCs these days. This has the usual features/specs as any other PC such as HDMI port, i5 processor, AC WiFi, etc. The video card is what sets this PC a part from other ""normal"" PCs. As far as gaming goes, this will run most games out there at medium graphics and some on full/high graphics. You can set the speed of the fans to keep the PC cool and the red keyboard backlight is pretty nice as well. 

Overall, I think this is an OK beginner/intermediate gaming laptop. To make it a nicer gaming PC, I think upping the RAM to 16GB (it holds 32GB max) and possibly replacing the HD to a SSD would make this a much nicer gaming PC.",LouRevue,Basic/mid range gaming PC,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",3
"When looking at gaming laptops at this price point, you realize that sacrifices need to be made and corners need to be cut. Overall, this is a good machine that is capable of running games in all it's 1080p glory. The display itself isn't as high end as some others but again, it does the trick. It seems that colors are a bit washed out and dull. The overall build quality is decent: brushed aluminum with plastic everywhere else. The I/O is good enough, has enough to connect external peripherals, usb c, SD card, and HDMI. All of these which are pretty important for gaming and being on the go. The front speakers are ok, loud enough but they are located on the front of the laptop which makes me think that gamers will stick with their gaming headsets. Battery life seems a bit on the low side when running tasks and doing some light gaming. Acer likes to load in a lot if its bloatware but that's easy to remove. Overall, this laptop is on the beefier side but for all the multi tasking and mid range gaming that you can do, it is definitely worth considering.",HoMi3,Better than average,1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",4
"The Acer Nitro fills a very important role in the mid level gaming category that I feel is desperately needed at this time in the PC gaming market. With a good price point and great price per performance this is a great laptop for anyone looking to get into PC gaming or anyone who wants an all around good PC gaming laptop.
The GTX 1050 card that is integrated into the laptop is still a very capable card in this day and age and can play most games on high to ultra depending on the age of the game and the required hardware specs for higher settings. The IPS monitor ensures good screen visibility from almost any angle and looks amazing. The 1TB hard drive seems slow in comparison to todays SSD's on most laptops but for a gaming PC meant to hold several games I can see the reason for going with a larger more traditional hard drive at this price point.
Overall this laptop is a great performing laptop and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good mid level gaming PC.",jonnyd2885,Great Mid Level Gaming PC,2,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB Hard Drive - Shale Black",4
"This is my first gaming computer. It has a lot of great qualities. Setup is very easy. Just turn it on and follow on-screen instructions while listening to Cortana guiding you through. The video card is absolutely amazing. So clear and crisp and colors are awesome making things look real. The sound is excellent. The colorful lights of the keyboard make for good aesthetics in the evening and are an aid if you are in a dim room. 

Games seem so much faster than on my regular PC. It is very quiet when it is on and even when the fan is going you can hardly hear it. A really nice feature that you don’t always find on a laptop is the rubber grips on the bottom. They secure the laptop from slipping off of just about any surface.

Only reason that I dont put 5 stars is that when I am running the laptop hard in game it can heat up a little and the fans sound like a jet engine trying to keep it cool.

"I have a PC that is about 6 months old with statistically better attributes than this laptop, but it doesn't perform any where near as well as this laptop. This surprised the heck out of me, especially considering that my PC is meant for gaming and has so much more real estate for components. 

I have done some web surfing, some emailing, but mainly I am using this laptop to play games such as Public Battlegrounds and Fortnite, which it is excelling at. PubG graphics settings are set pretty high and I am seeing over 100fps a vast majority of the time. I have not seen a single noticeable dip during intense fighting, even in the red zone, and the picture is CLEAR. Fortnite isn't anywhere near as demanding as PubG, but it also runs flawlessly. I need to get a second mouse to use with this laptop, so I have been using a controller (both Xbox One and PS4) and they also integrate very well with this computer. 

The CPU also stays cold during gaming. While monitoring, it never rose above 50* C. The keyboard is pretty nice also. I prefer it to my gaming keyboard on my PC, and I really appreciate having the number pad for using this laptop for something other than gaming. This laptop also came with a very nice travel sleeve that zips shut and matches the simple, yet stylish aesthetics of this laptop.

The only issues I can see with this laptop is the ""feel"" of the touch pad isn't to my liking and it shows fingerprints very easily. You shouldn't use it for gaming (no one does, I know), but it is slightly awkward during normal use as well. I find myself right clicking a lot when I mean to left click, as there aren't any visually defined buttons, but I am sure that will come with continued use. Also, the fan gets a little loud, but with the work it is doing, I don't mind the extra noise.

"Okay so I'll be honest, I was not expecting to have the best experience on this machine...but I was wrong. 

This laptop is so nice, it's unreal for the price it's being sold for. Lots of people want to buy a gaming laptop, but just can't or do not want to spend a ton of money on one. This is where Acer stepped in, and got it right. I like that it has an SSD option, because hard-drives can be very loud in my experience. 

When I first pulled this out of the box, I thought what did I get myself into? Because it's heavy, I mean 5.95lbs heavy. I know a lot of people will not move around with this much, but when you do you feel it. The screen is nice, and the keyboard is fantastic. Macbook Pro 2015 fantastic keyboard. I like how it has the red lights as well, reminds me of the old alien wear laptops. 

I immediately started playing games with I got it all setup, and well...it's awesome. The frame rates didn't drop, and the game play was smooth. What more can I say? I played several games, and non had an issue. Now it's only been a week or so, but I don't think it will give me issues down the line. I'm hoping not. 

The battery life is pretty good, lasting me several hours with gaming. You will need to charge it though if you stay on it with heavy graphic intense games. I also noticed that when you are not gaming, it's an amazing machine for editing, because it has the GeForce graphics card. It will be used for more than gaming, so having 8GB of RAM is a must. I believe you can also upgrade it to 32GBs of RAM if needed. Anyway, this laptop is a gamers dream if they don't want to drop $5000 on a big rig machine. It has all the ports you will need to get you started, and again it's a NICE laptop if nothing else. Good job ACER! I have other ACER laptops, and so far they are all great.",mrjlwilliams,"Wow, Wow, Wow...",1,0,"Acer - Nitro 5 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black",5
"This laptop is actually pretty good. All its hardware and specs provide a very versatile and cohesive package made perfect for gaming geared more to the mid-demand side of things. WHat I mean by that is this PC is capable of running some the year old goodies such as Fallout New Vegas on ultra 60fps as well as the newest low demand games (Realm Royale, Smite, LoL) at high settings 60+fps. I was skeptical about GTX 1050 TI's capabilites but was shocked to see MGSV: The Phantom Pain ran on max 1080p setting at a 55-60fps. As far as internet browsing and such goes, this laptop has no issues. The specs are their, near all stuff is tackled by them. There are two issues holding this laptop back from being 5 stars: 1) The screen is TOO dark. Even after clicking through caliberations/settings it just does not get bright enough. It isn't so bad that its hindering games, but it definitely is noticable. 2) It runs a little too hot for me to be comfortable. Just casual web surfing is pushing 85-95f and then all the way up to about 130-140f when playing games. The cooling system in it is pretty good though.

"Dell Gaming Laptop is a very powerful laptop and is able to handle most games at epic/ultra settings in 1080p. This laptop is great for games like Fortnite or Overwatch, as they run well on this machine. 

It can connect to my Bluetooth portable speaker with no issues. It is very good at multitasking thanks to the Core i7. With 16 GB ram, it can run a virtual machine without issues.

Sound quality on the external speakers is not the best in market, however the sound drivers are extraordinary in the headphones or earphones. Great during gaming. 
 
The overall build quality is amazing. It is a bit heavy though, but it is fine considering the config and the stability of the system. I love that it's silent and there is literally no heat coming out of it. The number pad is placed perfectly as well as the arrow keys. Even though the arrow keys are not labeled with the fn functions, you can still hold fn arrow key and get the home, end, page up, page down functionality so its not the end of the world with them being at the top right in an inconvenient place. The metal frame keeps cool to the touch and cleans easy. The matted screen is very nice and makes it easy to work near a window or while outside. The frame is strong enough to rest my hand on it while it overhangs with no flex. 

This laptop is great for gamers out there that just want a better playing experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",Honestreviewer151987,Great Gaming laptop!!,1,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",4
"I purchased the G7 to replace a Dell Alienware 17R4 I passed on to a family member. I didn't need the power of the 17R4 and was looking for something more portable. The build quality and styling of the G7 is excellent. While some people will bemoan the bezel size and brightness of the display, I do not have a problem with either, given the cost savings. Some people will also take issue with the relative thickness of the laptop in this age of ""thin & light"" gaming laptops. However as a previous owner of an MSI GS62, I was always uncomfortable with the seeming fragility of the laptop, especially after spending $2000. I appreciate the solid feel of the G7, even with its plastic body. The only downside I have found is that the M.2 slot is not NVMe, so SSD speeds are not as fast as could be. Like the display, I do not mind this, as the laptop is inexpensive for a 8th Generation i7/1060 Max-Q configuration. Overall a quality machine for a good price.",Avataris,Excellent value for a gaming laptop,3,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"Great performance/ cost ratio. This laptop played most of my games on steam at max settings without a problem. The best thing about this laptop is how easy upgrading is. All upgradable components are easily accessible and you can even add a 2nd hard drive for additional storage. Even though this was made for gaming, it handles everyday tasks extremely well due to the i7 processor. Perfect balance of performance. The blue lit keyboard is a plus as well as the feel of the keyboard. There are only two downsides, one being the screen. It is anti glare and doesn't get to bright. It is easy to see from any angles so while I prefer bright screens some will prefer anti glare over brightness. The other thing I wish was better was the size of the power brick. It is huge so picking a good laptop bag is important. It wasn't an issue for me since I use a backpack but still adds bulk. These two items are in no way deal breakers and this laptop should be someones first choice, especially if they are a casual gamer.",GeorgeM77,One of the best gaming laptops for the price.,1,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5
"The Dell G7 is a great laptop, suitable for just about anything, but really shines with gaming.

Since it has a solid-state drive, it has incredibly snappy startup times, and programs load quickly. The hard drive is 256GB, but if you need more storage space, you can always expand it with an SD card.

My favorite feature is having a backlit keyboard. I didn't really understand why anyone would want or need this feature, but now that I have it, I LOVE it. It makes working in dark rooms easy and convenient. 

Gaming is also totally doable on this system, thanks to its Nvidia GeForce 1060 graphics card. The large air vents and dual fan system helps the laptop stay cool while playing graphically demanding games, but it can get a bit loud, although this is to be expected with any current generation gaming laptop.

"I purchased one yesterday and exchanged because the first had a lot of back lighting bleed on the display because of the plastic bezel. The second one is much better. It's not really noticeable unless your screen is black or watching a movie that is dark. It was just on the top right by the webcam. Maybe me just being picky... Overall though - This laptop is very powerful. Using an Oculus Rift on it now. Fan is noisy as most gaming laptops. If you get, I would recommend getting more RAM and Storage. 256GB will not last long nowadays and 8GB is only good for basic stuff and maybe a little RAM intensive apps. I really like it and can't beat the price for what you get. If you are only looking to get this for basic stuff, I would recommend others, but for gaming, VR, or high GPU / CPU usage - definitely a great option.",Booda2000,Powerful and Fast Gaming Laptop,5,0,"Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Licorice Black",5

I am both a busy professional and a gamer. I needed something lightweight and mobile enough to transport to Starbucks, but also something where I can play games at a reasonable frame rate.

"Recently having purchased a MSI GS63 Stealth 8RE, here is my review of the laptop. From the first start up it has shown to be uniquely reactive and on a visual stand point is a true gem to behold. MSI has managed to bundle together the perfect package of power and aesthetics to make a laptop that is not only well rounded, perennial and agreeable to use, but also transportable and robust. Once the onslaught of Microsoft updates are finished to pass to build 1803 of Windows 10, one finds a stable and agreeable laptop ready to attach any and all projects or games including even the most demanding in resources.

"I was already a fan of MSI laptops. I own one of the older Apache Pro models, and I purchased my GF one of their business models for her school and work.

Recently I needed a new machine for game development (and maybe a little bit of Sea of Thieves shannanery.) I needed something more portable then my steadfast Apache. I have always loved MSI for not just the affordability and well tested part configurations, but for their reinforced metal frames and tight hinges.

Nothing feels loose on this laptop. It is incredibly sturdy, and quite thin for a gaming laptop. Beautiful design with full lit keyboard, with customization lighting. Plenty of USBs, great sound for a laptop too (not too tinny). The cooler boost also works very well to re-distribute the heat.

I was very impressed with the amount of hardware that it came with for the price we spent on it, very comparable to other brands but this one seemed to have a little ""extra"" for the same price (if not cheaper). Watching her use it for our various gaming we do together, I was taken away by how well it handled all the graphics without over heating, how fast/quick all the applications responded to us, load times, etc... and how fun some of the extra features are to use (I.E. the keyboard). In short, we were in best buy yesterday, saw this model was still available, and I just had to have one for myself.

This MSI laptop is a power house in a thin form. I have played games on it for about two months and it can handle games well.

The color is configurable and the light is bright. The laptop came with an eight gen cpu I7 and plenty of ram to make it out of the box a great buy. no need to upgrade for now. The 15.6 is display is better than my old hp 17.3 and is still light enough that it is easy to carry. This pc really has a thin form factor but still big gaming capability.

"I read all the reviews and understood everything I was getting before my purchase. 3 days in and I do not regret buying this gaming laptop. It was meant to replace my desktop that was aging, and it has done just that.

Pros: 
SCREEN - An IPS screen running at 60hz with vibrant colors and a crisp image. I'm aware that it is not running at the advertised 120hz, but again I knew this before the purchase.

GPU - Its a GTX 1060 that runs around 76c when I'm pushing it hard. I connect this laptop up to my external monitor for gaming and run everything at 144hz. 76c is a respectable number for what I put it through.

CPU - Its an 8th gen I7. What more could you want. It makes everything snappy and fast.

BUILD QUALITY - Very solid build altogether. Nothing is flimsy and seems like it will stand the test of time. One of the reasons I bought this was because of the slim form factor. Its very easy to transport and move from one room to another if need be.

Cons:
HDD - This is just a small con. They should have forgotten about the mechanical drive and just put in a 512GB SSD. And not using m.2.

"This is a gaming laptop and therefore has a separate video card with additional memory on it. A huge plus when running a program like Photoshop. My previous laptop was a touch screen and I had a lot of trouble with it. This laptop does not have a touch screen which was a big plus for me. Also, when I did my research, I found out that MSI actually beat out Apple at the CES show this year in Las Vegas. Since so many photographers tend to use Apple products and I prefer Windows, this was another big plus for me. Also, from what I can see in my limited testing, it seems to handle Photoshop well (with all of the memory it has, I don't forsee running into a problem with it). 

There are a couple of aspects that I would like to point out not to deter someone from buying the laptop but just so that you don't go into it blind and things I hope the manufacturer will consider when designing the next models of their laptops. The big one is the keyboard. On other laptops that I have had, there has been a standard (Courier or Times Roman) font. This one is different. The letters are rounded and the zero has a slash going through it like the Europeans or military write the number. Also, the W and E look like the E turned 90 degrees and the D and the O look very similar on the keyboard. I am used to the Delete key being above the Backspace key and the Windows key being on the left side of the Space Bar. These are things that I can get used to, but for a little bit I am sure I will make some errors until I do get used to it.

Overall, I would give this laptop a 4.5 out of 5 but that option is not available to me.",Photoman401,This Review Is Slanted Toward A Photographer,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",4
"As Streamer and YouTuber, I love this laptop, is perfect when I'm playing a random video game and streaming at Twitch or YouTube at the same time. The personalization on the keyboard has multiple functions that you can spend hours (I still can't make 1 that's better than the disco mode). I had tested the power of this laptop with the games I have like ""We Happy Few"" or ""CS:GO"" on the best graphics possible and I hadn't experience lag. 
The price is fair with the quality it gives.
I can carry it around easily on my backpack for school purposes or just for gaming at a friend house.
It works perfectly with Streamlabs OBS, so I'm happy with that.
The only thing I hate is that the material is...unclean I guess... when is new you can't see anything out of normal but with the time with just putting a finger you can tell that someone touches it...

"I should disclose first that I am not a gamer. I bought the unit for converting audio and editing photos and video in a portable Windows based format. 
This unit is very snappy running Light room and reasonable Photoshop. Batch converting photos is quick too. the i7-8750H is mostly using 1 to 2 cores in these applications. 
Using either Premier Pro or dBPowerAmp batch converters is another story because they (especially the latter) utilize all 6 CPUscores as 12 threads . It still runs well but affter about 60 seconds CPU cores temps climbed to 88C using MSIs built in utility. Lowest cores temps were 82C highest were 88C. CPU temps should not be sustained that high. I then had the unit professionally repasted. Same circumstance and applications. 78-81C without really asking much of the GPU.. 
I don't know how this translates to gaming as my apps use as much power as possible during rendering video or converting audio formats. 
They are vague about the hardware so I can fill in a couple of blanks. 
The 256GB SSD is m.2 format, but it is NOT NVME. It is SATA It is an OEM Samsung device. The HDD is 5400 RPM . The Ram is DDR4-2400. Only the 2.5"" harddisk is easily accessible.

"Recently I began looking for a new laptop. Previously I had been running a standard laptop, but with technology and kids. It was becoming clear that I would need more than the standard laptop. each week I sit down and play various games with my kid and my laptop wasn't cutting it, our big gaming desktop was well old to say the least ( gen2 I7). So with days of research on the computer and many trips to the big box stores to research in person with demos, I came across the GS63 stealth and the GS65 stealth thin.

I went with the GS63, And here is why.

Dual hard drives this comes with a m.2 256 gb ssd and a 1tb 3.5 hard drive which gives you a fair amount of space right out of the box

a full keyboard with number pad 

In my opinion a little more stout housing granted both the 63 and 65 have flex in there chassis to me the 63 has less

Now heres where it got hard to choose and to justify the 500 dollar price difference 
GPU: Tthe 63 comes with a gtx 1060 running at 6gb, the 65 runs a 1070 max-q at 8gb. thru the reviews and benchmark tests the 1070 just barely squeaks by the 1060 in most of the tests and thats usually in ultra graphic setting. the 1070 max-q was designed to be a cooler running gpu for laptop settings because of this they had to dial it back some. because of this i couldnt see the extra money being worth it for a dialed back 1070

Display: the displays are both 1080 res but the 65 has a 144hz refresh rate, the 63 only has a 60 hz rate, win for the 65 still why did i go for the 63 simple when i game its usually not derectly on the laptop when im gaming its usually plugged into a monitor with a full mechanical keyboard etc i needed portability for other things, not gaming but didnt want 2 machines.

When it all came down to it the 63 suited my needs just fine at a better price point, still a very tough decision the 65 being a great machine and a very sharp unit. the 65 does offer dual m.2 ssd slots in its chassis but comes with a single 512gb out of the box, also both laptops do support up 32gb of ram and both have thunderbolt 3 usb type c connectors should down the road the internal gtx 1060 or 1070 shouldnt cut it anymore these laptops could be mated with eGPU enclosures to prolong your need to upgrade. 

I definitly recommend both the GS63 and the newer GS65.
Also at the time of purchace I picked up the GS63 8RE edition this is upgraded with the newer 6 core I7, the same as the newly release GS65 the specs per MSI website will be close the biggest differences is the 1060 vs 1070 max-q gpu and the 60 vs 144hz refresh rates on the screen everything else is pretty close or the same",Burrito2158,Very Tough Decision.....,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"Design and quality: Not much changed from the GS63VR except for the logo on the back and improved speakers .... or as opposed to the 6RF I had before, speakers are a whole step up. As stated, rest is pretty much the same, which is REALLY good, because the 63 series is such a wonderful and beautiful machine machine. The build quality fells great man, what can I tell you. Hands down, steelseries makes the best keyboard around. Not just the silver lining, or however its called, but the feeling of the keyboard, key travel, feedback, etc... is just perfect for me. As a programmer, that is one of my number one things about a laptop. Another thing to highlight is the ""alloy"" chasis, which doesn't get hot. I also love the upper double air intake of the cooling system... Anyhow, I like it a lot.

The screen is something to highlight as well... it looks really awesome (after some calibration with the built in True Color thingy).

Performance: I was just playing BF1 for about an hour, and regardless of the fact i got my butt kicked hard, the GPU stayed on the low 70s and the CPU on at 78-82 degrees. FPS and such were as expected, 60 solid with v-sync on and the machine did not even break a sweat. The two improvements come from two sides: CPU (kaby lake) and the NVME ssd (SAMSUNG MZVPV256). that gives the computer quite the push coming from the previous one which ssd was a regular one. I also replaced the 2nd drive for a 512 GB Samsung 850 Pro, so I am golden.
Summarizing, when I game, I do not have to worry about anything else... that alone says a lot, as opposed to some other brands with failed products (Razer, yeah you heard me fan-boy, and you know it - so disappointed). There's nothing you can throw to this thing and you won't run flawlessly.

"I bought this computer open boxed certified excellent, which means it was basically in new condition with all the documents still present. I believe the first person who bought this returned it right away for the same reason I did. That reason would be fan noise. I know a lot of the reviews said the fans were very loud but they were fine with it because they used head phones. I knew the fans were going to be loud, but the level of noise greatly exceeded my expectations. To give you an idea of how loud it is, it is almost like being in a plane that is taking off. I don't know if it was just the one I bought but it would get very loud and very often. I was not even using resource heavy applications with it. The most demanding thing I did with the computer when I had it for a night was play League of Legends. If you buy this computer, forget about taking it to the library, school, a coffee shop, or any where else you might potentially bother people because you will bother them.",reviewer88,Great computer with a major flaw,4,2,"ASUS - ROG GU501GM 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hybrid Drive + 128GB SSD - Brushed Black",2

"Only spent a few hours with it so far, but my impressions are overall very positive. Beautiful, great bright screen, and super quick & responsive. Read one review that the keyboard was a little off with it sagging or bending slightly in the middle, but I haven't experienced that at all. If anything I think it's great with a decent firmness. I'm used to Lenovo T or X1 series keyboards and this is fairly similar. Only major compliant is the left/right click on touchpad, which becomes a non-issue if you get used to multi touch gestures. The fan whirl is real, but not overly loud IMO. 

Main reason I picked this laptop over others with similar specs was the weight which was well worth the price. I'm extremely mobile in my job so every pound in my backpack is felt. This one is a solid 1-1.5lbs lighter than most similarly speced laptops, and my back thanks MSI for that.

"My gaming PC died and I had been looking at replacing it. My wife and I also do some software development and had been using a surface. I spent some time looking at Razer Laptops and had decided that replacing the desktop with a gaming laptop would be the way to go. It would be easier to move in the house as well as take to LAN parties. It would also give a better platform for development than the surface and its type cover. (Not to knock the Surface 3, it is my favorite tablet/ultrabook out there) I spent some time looking at Razor before coming across the MSI GS65.

Personally I think the GS65 is much better looking than the razors with its black and copper trim. Also you get alot more for your money with the MSI verses any of the Razor laptops. 

So far, it has performed flawlessly. As others mention there is some work on setup to get windows updated and get some of the bloatware removed.

Plus, all of my non VR titles can be played on ultra settings. My only major complaint is that there's a little bit of flex to the top case, especially around the right palm rest above the battery. Though most of the time it's barely noticeable, it's not something I would expect out of a notebook at this price. Also, while the speakers are loud and clear, they lack power in the low range.

"I've been using the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin for about 3 weeks now. I decided to purchase it because I travel a lot for work and would like to play some games on the road. Overall this laptop is very nice. The screen looks amazing and the 144 Hz refresh rate is great. I usually bump it down to 60 Hz when on battery though to conserve battery life. I've been getting around 8-9 hours battery life (no games, just watching videos, writing emails, and work related stuff). Gaming is amazing on this laptop. A GTX 1070 Max Q easily handles any game I want to play. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle games, video editing, etc on the go, this is the laptop for you.

There are only a few negatives to this laptop. It's a fingerprint magnet. MSI does include a cleaning cloth with the laptop but it's not very good. I don't like that the speakers are on the bottom, though they are loud. Using headphones is probably best with the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. There is a lot of flex in the chassis, though I think that's how MSI achieved such a low weight in this laptop.

"My experience on GS65 is a little bit complicated. I ordered the first batch of this laptop on BestBuy and pick up by myself on 5/9 in West Hollywood. The laptop seems to be pretty delicate. As an ultra-thin gaming laptop, I don't wanna be too harsh on its surface temperature. However, maybe I'm quite unlucky, I met almost all the defects that I've seen on the Internet: severe screen bleeding on the left edge, terrible touch pad with unpressable buttons, suddenly high-spin fans in normal conditions and frequent fake system halts. You can say that these are not big problems, but they left me very bad impression.

Good news is that when I choose to change a new one on 5/31, things become different. Those small defects have totally gone. The differences that I have noticed include a new SATA SSD (Toshiba SG6 instead of Samsung PM871A) and two black fans for the graphics card instead of one red and one black on the old batch. I have no idea why MSI made these changes. What I know is that this batch of laptop might have much better quality. It's good time for those who have interests in GS65 to take it home!

P.S.: I know that many people also take an eye on the new Razer Blade 15. Before you make your decision, think about Razer's previous quality control and whether you can accept at least $400 gap. GS65 is not perfect, but it definitely worth its price.",4490171394,It's time for you to take it home,3,1,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I only recently bought this laptop and will update the more i use it, but after quickly installing my key games and using the device for several hours, i can already tell that this was an excellent choice. 

I love the new sleek design that MSI is using for the GS65 model. It gives it a premium look and does not shock as you take it into your office. 

I had read reviews regarding screen burn, dead pixels and a trackpad that was horrible to use. As far as my experience none of that is true. The trackpad is excellent and the only thing i had to change was the scrolling direction, to match what i was used to. The screen quality is excellent and games look great. 

The steelseries keyboard with custom color configurations is sweet, you can make pretty much any look you desire. 

The only cons i would have are as follows - 
1. When under extreme workload the fans can indeed get pretty loud. A little louder than i have been used to in a laptop. This however is not a huge deal as i typically wear headphones if i am playing any game that will cause strain on the system. 
2. there are areas in which the plastic body does flex, taking away from the overall quality of the device. I assume this is how they are able to get such a light laptop.

"So I picked up the 037 model that has 16gb ram and the 1070 gpu. overall it is a really good looking laptop that doesn't scream gamer which I like and is the main reason I purchased it. The screen looks great and the keyboard is pretty good to type with. However, it does lack a num pad which I have used on all my laptops and is a real adjustment for me but not a deal breaker. As many other reviewers have stated the touchpad isnt the greatest but not as bad as some are saying. This laptop does have lots of ports on the sides with 3 usbs a lighting and hdmi out but it is lacking a sd card reader which I tend to use since i upload lots of pictures off my Nikon. For gaming this laptop is great and the 144hz screen is excellent, but you will want to use headphones as the speakers on the bottom are not the loudest. The only other real complaint I have is that to upgrade ram or storage is a bit more then just taking of the bottom cover. It requires you to remove small cables to flip the motherboard over which some might want to have a shop do for you, and you will want to upgrade storage since these models don't offer high storage. All in all though this is a really good laptop that looks clean and performs great.",Rydens85,Super Stealthy,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"Build Quality:
- Pros: Light, very stealthy, good track pad
- Cons: more reinforcement in panels so it doesn’t creek

Performance:
- Pros: Fast refresh rate makes it seem very fast, great most games I played at 1080 between high and ultra settings for 90-120 FPS average
- Cons: Not much, other than runs a bit hot when gaming (which doesn’t matter since you won’t really put it on your lap while you game)
Screen:
- Pros: Color accurate, covers decently wide spectrum of AdobeRGB which basically means you can actually use it for content creation (casual creation). I don’t use it for that so the display for me is very good for my tasks of playing games, watching videos, office and engineering programs with it’s super smooth 144hz refresh rate .
- Cons: None at this price point unless you want a 4k display which I do not recommend (144hz 1080p is better than 60Hz 4k which would take from the performance anyway)
Battery:
- Ok for use on battery saving mode to watch some videos browse and other light activities. When you want to play games or other intensive tasks battery is ok for a gaming laptop but if your coming from something like an lg gram it is pretty bad (but battery isn’t the reason you buy a gaming laptop anyway)
Keyboard and trackpad:
- Nice feeling overall for both and would say they are second best in class following the razor (trackpad) and the aero (keyboard)
Overall:
- Best all round gaming laptop in class when you consider the cost and what you get. I would say the razor blade 2018 might be slightly better laptop for this segment but at 300-500 dollars more it just is no where near worth it.",Husainaj,BEST OVERALL GAMING LAPTOP IN CLASS!,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"Pros:
-Thin and light
-Amazing keyboard
-Gtx 1070 max q along with 144hz screen (no gsync)
-Battery Life (6-8 hours) while browsing/streaming
-Fans are fairly quiet even on max
Cons:
-Serviceability (if you want to install another SSD, you better be good at tinkering because for some awful reason they flipped the motherboard, meaning you have to take out the whole motherboard to install another SSD or upgrade the memory)
-The temperature (CPU reaches 91 degrees celsius while gaming, recommend undervolting with Intel XTU)
- BACKLIGHT BLEED (im on my 2nd unit already, this one has really noticeable backlight bleed on the bottom left, the first one had it at the top and bottom but not nearly as prominent as this one) 3rd times the charm right?
-The storage is slower than expected for a m.2 non NVME ( I was hoping for a pretty snappy system, but my gosh the drive they used on this model is slow when compared to my normal SATA samsung EVO drive) 

Final thoughts: 
Other than the terrible backlight bleed that I have been getting (gonna have to return and get a new unit and hope for the best) and the flipped motherboard (an inconvenience to upgrade the parts inside), then I highly recommend this laptop. For the price that I got ($1899) with the student discount, It is overall an amazing laptop. Best one I have used in a long time.

"So I've had this laptop for only a little while, and while wanted to rate this at 4.5 stars, Bestbuys rating system doesn't let you. Overall, this is a fantastic laptop that I highly recommend. 8th gen I7, gtx 1070 (maxq), 16gb of ram, 144hz ips like screen! All in a sleek slim profile! Simply amazing, What more could you ask for? But I have encountered a couple things that I didn't like about this laptop. Immediately, I noticed right away that the cpu will thermal throttle under an intensive load. I know that because this is a slim design some sacrifice had to be done on the cooling system. Understandable. My work around on this was to under volt the cpu and it is a must to have a cooling pad. It runs warm but at least it doesn't thermal throttle completely now. Maybe considering a repaste to further reduce temps. I'm not docking MSI for that, as you can only do so much in that space. However I would dock MSI a half star for this next issue. The other thing that i don't like on this laptop is that, if you want to upgrade/expand storage or components, you have to take the motherboard out. Yes, you read right. Although, it doesn't seem to be too complicated, its still a huge inconvenience. I just wanted to simply put in my spare m.2 drive that I had, but it seems like that's going to be a 45 min job and some praying so that I don't break any ribbon cables. With that said, I still love this laptop. Its just so beautiful and has the perfect amount of power behind it. Highly recommend.",Matt,Beautiful GS65 stealth thin gaming laptop,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I've been toying with the idea of adding a gaming laptop to the computer arsenal for all the times I don't want to walk off into the man cave. Until recently I wasn't impressed enough with what was out there to take the plunge. I'm also quite spoiled by using Mac Pros & Macbook Pros for the past decade. I've also been building Windows machines since the 286 chip. I like both Operating Systems for their strengths and use them accordingly. And my point is, I appreciate the combination of good software and hardware that create an enjoyable computing experience.

The MS65 keyboard is fantastic. I think it is a good blend of travel and clickiness. The trackpad is another story. Being spoiled by the Mac trackpad it is hard for any Windows machine to compete. I will say this is not nearly as bad as most. I would also recommend switching out the drivers for the better precision ones. Just Google ""MSI GS65 touchpad precision drivers."" 

Having lived on higher resolutions I was concerned about going back to 1080p. Can't say there are any problems. Everything looks pretty decent on this screen. And speedy refresh rates are incredibly underrated, so if this is your first >60 refresh rate you'll have a hard time going back.

Also picked up a SteelSeries Rival 310 mouse to match up with the keyboard. They pair nicely and the lighting effects are fun.

The things I don't like: missing media keys for play, next track, etc. I'm also not a fan of the high fan speed and heat buildup that comes during hefty loads, but I understand the trade-off for size/weight. Undervolting the CPU has helped a little. I'm trying to decide if it is annoying enough to switch out the thermal paste for liquid metal. 

Overall, this is a 5 star machine. Regardless of the minor issues reviewers state, and how harshly some may come across, I am impressed that so many still rate it 5 stars. In the battle against the Razer Blade & Gigabyte the keyboard, subtle styling, and extra M.2 slot were what pushed me toward MSI. I'm glad I went this way.",axsnyder,Does it all just fine,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"Here is what I love about the GS65 Stealth. It's fast. It rendered a Revit file at best quality in 1h 22m that a competing high-end laptop with a 7700HQ and double the RAM, a GTX 1050, and a much fast NVMe SSD writing at 4x the r/w speeds took 2h 17m. The screen quality is very good and the colors are accurate. The keyboard is mostly comfortable to type on. Finally, the laptop is thin, light, quiet (the second time around), and has excellent battery life when not playing games or rendering. One very nice touch is the SteelSeries RGB backlit keyboard. I just wanted lit keys, but the customizable per-key colors and brightness levels are really fantastic.

Here is how this laptop annoys me. First, these design choices are horrendous. Who in R&D decided that an upside-down mobo was a good idea? This was one of the worst decisions for the upgradeability. I work in IT and I don't even like to pull laptops apart. They're annoying and have little room. Plus, we have that delightful power connection on the right side cutting across the fan. The first laptop almost melted the cable. These are just ridiculously poor decisions on the design. Second, it's nowhere near as fast as it could be. The RAM is only 2400MHz and the SSD is non-NVMe. This is noticeable when rendering CAD files, when transferring lots of data, and when heavily multitasking. These are minor upgrades and could improve performance drastically. Third, the trackpad is fantastically bad. I had to have this exchanged because of the trackpad and poor build quality (loose piece of trim on the outside and temps over 90C when browsing the Internet). The second one is much better, but the trackpad frequently skips, freezes, and become non-responsive randomly. My next step is changing the Synaptics drivers for Windows Precision and hopefully that fixes it. Fourth, the sound of the fans on the one prior to exchanging it was irritating. Fifth is that annoying power light. It's extremely bright, in the middle of the laptop, and cannot be disabled while in use. Quite the opposite, in fact. It glows bright white while using the laptop. Not distracting at all. Finally, the build quality is pretty mediocre. Most reviews say that it's great, but I'm used to workstation-grade laptops and Macbook Pro aluminum unibody models that are really excellent quality and this just feels OK. Not cheap, per se, but definitely not as high end as it should be for the price. Even laptops at half the price feel like they're made of higher quality components. Now for the real issue. I only have one, everything else is easily lived-with.

The only truly awful aspect of this laptop is backlight bleed. It was consistent on both the original and replacement model. It's so bad that on any image that is even somewhat dark it's VERY noticeable. All four corners and along the whole bottom of the screen are just BAD. I have several laptops and, as an IT professional, work with many more and this level of bleed is just unacceptable in any laptop over $1000. If there were better options at this price-point with the weight, battery life, and a trackpad, I would be all over it. Unfortunately, there isn't one other than the Aero, and that's practically unavailable.

All in all, this is a good laptop. There's a lot of annoyances and the backlight bleed is terrible. However, I can overcome the speed annoyances and live with everything else.

This earns my recommendation, but only just. I would probably buy another one and recommend it to my clients if they were to request a powerful thin and light laptop.",CamNev,"It's good, but not as great as it could be...",1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",3
"Background: I do a lot of design work (civil engineering) as well as gaming, and have a desktop computer that can handle everything I need, but I've been increasingly mobile over the last couple years. So I was looking for a laptop that could handle everything I throw at it and then some for at least the next few years, have decent battery life, and be actually portable (as opposed to most gaming laptops) so it wasn't painful to walk around with. In short, this laptop absolutely fits that bill. There's a couple Cons, for sure, but they didn't ruin it for me. So here's a quick run down below:
Pros:
-Actually lightweight
-Decent battery, especially for a gaming laptop (5-7 with light office work and low screen brightness, but still 4-5 for design work, which is perfect for me)
-Ridiculously powerful. Seriously, out of the box, I put on Witcher 3, Total Warhammer II, and a couple other less impressive games, and it ran everything on Ultra flawlessly, which is still astounding to me for such a lightweight laptop. This will absolutely continue to run any game for the next 3-4 years at a minimum on very high settings.
-Might just be me, but I really like the keyboard. The feel of typing is great, and the placement of the FN key on the right side, *actually next* to all the buttons that use it (like changing brightness and volume, especially), allows me to quickly access those secondary functions with one hand. So that was easy to get used to, as I've usually seen that key placed on the left side of keyboards/laptops I've had. Also, not as important to me, but: the Steel Series software to control the keyboard lighting is very intuitive, accessible, and play around with.
-Doesn't look like a gaming laptop.
-Amazing screen. I've never been a snob for refresh rates or ""True color"" monikers, but this screen has *really* impressed me. For videos and video games, it's noticeable, but even tasks as simple as scrolling seem to happen more smoothly. Perhaps this is just expectation bias, though.
Cons:
-As others have said, this does indeed come with a lot of bloatware. Knowing this, though, I opened the package, and almost immediately did a fresh install of Windows that cleaned away a lot of it. Still spent another hour or so of uninstalling the still-installed games and other random software, and then re-downloading the major drives from the MSI product page (this includes the software for the keyboard, graphics cards, etc., and Windows will provide a list of the major programs not re-installed on your desktop after the fresh install). So it was just a couple hours of preparation after opening that isn't ideal, but wasn't a huge deal.
-Again, as others have mentioned, this does indeed get very hot under heavy load (for me, specifically, this was while running the aforementioned games). You can hear the fans start blaring, but there are parts of the laptop that are uncomfortably hot anyway. The fan noise is louder than average, I guess, but that didn't really bother me so much as concern for overheating; especially as I get into summer months without air conditioning. I will likely invest in a laptop cooling pad for this if and when I start doing more heavy gaming on it (though I'll likely just use my desktop for this, anyway, which has similar specs but no heating problem). Perhaps for longer work/travel trips where I'll only have my laptop, though.

Certainly the best laptop I've ever had, and it better have been for the price. But I most definitely expect this laptop to last for the next 5 or so years at a minimum, for work and play, so hopefully its endurance is as good as its sprint.",Tyler,"Fantastic, Powerful Laptop with Few Cons (for me)",1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I spent an entire month looking at laptops that were highly portability, weighed less than 5Ibs, and had very powerful components all while maintaining a stylish design that did not scream 'Gaming Laptop' to the world. After looking at laptops like the Razer, Alienware R4, Acer Predator Helios 300 and etc, and finding horror stories, negative customer reviews and learning about the common complaints that was associated to each of laptops of interest, I found this beautiful laptop that fit the criteria of everything I wanted in a Laptop: Portable, Stylish, Powerful, and no usual issues. So I am happy to own this beautiful laptop

Even the packaging was amazing, it has an out case that had protective foam to protect the inner case containing the laptop, with the laptop cover in final layer ensuring that it is protect from the moment it's purchased to the moment it's opened.
---------------------------------------------Pros-----------------------------------------
1.) The laptop is very light, weighing in at about 4 pounds, which I love because most of my laptops have been weighing in at 9ib and up

2.) The laptop contains a 1070 Max-Q GPU that is able to play just about any game you want on this laptop with at least high settings (tested with Tekken 7, Nier Automata, Crash Bandicoot, Call of Duty WW2 and etc). I am very happy with this laptop's power.

3.) The laptop can heat up fast, due to it's small size, when dealing with intensive programs. But this is dealt with by the cooler boost trinity (will make audible noise) 
---------------------------------------------Cons----------------------------------------
1.) I have not been able to use this laptop for 8+ hours straight on a single charge, but it's still great for a laptop of it's size with the power that it contains all while having a professional appearance to it

"First, I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. This is not a perfect 5/5 laptop, but better than a 4/5 one.

I'm a college professor who plays games. I'm going to be using this mostly for work/school but don't want to be throttled when I am playing games. I also do some light video editing and other graphic design stuff.

Pros:
- Very fast processor and great graphics performance
- The screen is amazing! I'm more impressed with 144 hz than I thought I would be.
- The keyboard is very pleasant to type on and the changing colors are cool
- The laptop just looks great and has a very nice profile
- Light and easily portable

Cons:
- The build quality leaves much to be desired. 
 I had to immediately return the first unit I purchased because the bottom panel was screwed on too tight in the front-center just under the touchpad. It warped the profile of the laptop and was causing issues with the touchpad. It also cause a very loud cracking sound where the plastic pieces were rubbing against one another. It was immediately apparent as I was taking the laptop out of the box.
I returned the unit and do have one that is much better; however, there is still some of the same cracking noise between the plastic pieces. Even now as I'm typing, as I slightly lift my hands up to type there is creaking noises. I am probably going to try and tighten or loosen the screws. Maybe even take off the bottom panel and see if there is something else I can do to lessen this problem. Ultimately, this is unacceptable for a $2,000 laptop. I was looking at the HP Spectre x360 before and those are built rock solid. If I was looking only at build quality, I would return this immediately, go for the HP and get $500 back. But I would lose some power, which is why I am not doing that.

Maybe Con: Speakers aren't the best but I'll rarely use them so it doesn't matter much to me.

Bottom Line: Check your laptop before you leave the parking lot to make sure that it was properly manufactured. Best Buy did handle the exchange for a new one very well; it was only a minor inconvenience. If you do find the build quality to be acceptable, then this is a wonderfully fantastic laptop that otherwise exceeded my expectations.

"This is the third MSI laptop I have owned (GT627-218, and GS60 Ghost Pro 4K-238) and while my previous one was still viable for casual gaming, I felt this was a worthwhile upgrade. It also addresses some of the issues I have had with the GS60. First and foremost, I’d like to go on record to say that the GS60 is a great midrange gaming laptop that has served me well for the 2+ years I’ve owned it. At the time of its purchase, my only complaint was that the GeForce 10 series laptops had come out right after purchase. That being said, it’s held up fairly well with modern games. 

The main reasons I wanted to upgrade were that the gs60 didn’t seem to work with the Oculus/Vive VR headsets and the 4K resolution, while spectacular, didn’t get enough of a boost from the graphics card to play many games at 4K with anything other than low settings. The only other complaint I had was that the backlit keys were sort of lacking as they were not able to be set individually. With that in mind, I set out looking at other reviews and checking in stores for some of the other models available from different manufacturers. During this time, the GS65 Stealth Thin was released and I happened upon it while looking at the GS63 as a possible candidate. I immediately was drawn to the gold lines and the very thin bezel around the screen. While the GS63 shares a similar chassis to the GS60, the GS65 is a departure and to anyone comparing the two, the differences are immediately apparent. Unfortunately, there were little to no reviews on the web for this beauty for almost 2 weeks save for a thread on reddit about it. So I had to obsess over the MSI site and it’s specs list patiently. However, a few reviews started cropping up and I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail that has gone into this machine over the earlier models. It jumped to the top contender of my list, save for the fact that aside from a display model, Best Buy didn’t seem to have it available in stock and a shipping time of the end of May. I lucked out today as one of the more distant Best Buys in my area had one in stock today, and so I jumped on it without hesitation. My pros and cons list so far is fairly short as it’s based on only a half of a day of use, so time will tell if I have more to add to the list. 

On the plus side, this thing is very classy and gorgeous in a subtle way. It has enough power to sit at an upper mid to low high end portable gamer position without breaking your back, lap, or bank. 

My only gripes thus far, are that while impressively light, it does feel kind of fragile and I fear a real possibility of it bending/flexing. While I haven’t opened it up, I’ve seen a few teardown articles which show the upgradable parts (ram and ssd) on the reverse side of the motherboard which makes upgrading something out of the reach of many users.",Glyphic,Excellent balance of portability and power for,1,0,"MSI - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Matte Black With Gold Diamond Cut",5
"I was super excited for this laptop. The Razer Blade Stealth was my daily driver for a while, but I decided that I needed a laptop with a graphics card for the graphic design work that I do. So I sold it and splurged to get this laptop. The specs seemed unreal and the aesthetic change MSI made looked much better than before. 

So I bought it. The performance and the look of the laptop were top notch. The build quality was meh, but I figured I could deal with it. There was only one little issue -- the space bar was not working correctly! One side of the mechanism wasn't manufactured correctly. Also, the laptop would creak every time I placed my hands on it to type, which is slightly annoying and doesn't sound very nice. So -- I brought it back and exchanged for another one. The space bar now works, hooray! But alas, the left speaker is blown/vibrating at certain frequencies and the creaking is still there. I thought maybe I could deal with it. Guess what? Here I am, just about a week later from owning it, and the enter key decides to stop working when it wants to. Also, there are a couple black specs in the screen that I cannot get rid of. On top of that, after carrying this laptop in my backpack for the last week or so, I'm starting to notice some warping in the screen. 

I'm very frustrated with this laptop. I'm so happy using it, and I really want to enjoy it. Game performance is unreal and it's amazing for my design work. But the build quality of this laptop is seriously driving me away from it. I would have never considered a Macbook before, but this laptop has convinced me that build quality in a laptop is important and certainly a deal breaker for me. 

Even if I decided to exchange this laptop for a SECOND TIME, I'm afraid that I'm going to run into issues after a month or two months of owning it. I don't have any confidence in the reliability of this laptop. I'm surprised that others aren't running into these issues.

"I'll start with my needs.

I need a laptop that is powerful, fast, and has plenty of SSD memory for my many active game projects. ✔
I need Windows 10. ✔
I need a laptop that is lightweight. ✔
I need a laptop that has decent battery life. ✔
I need a laptop that looks professional when meeting with clients. ✔

I did days of research leading up to this purchase. I actually hadn't purchased a laptop for about 7 years. I'm a conservative guy! The problem with my ageing laptop was the low disk space, slow startup, and huge hulkish build. In school I was happy to lug that thing around! Your cost to power ratio are pretty good with a desktop replacement laptop. As I left school and started my career in game development my needs changed. 

To say this laptop is powerful is a given. I have to have power when I'm working in the Unity Game Engine 8 hours a day. I need productivity. Every ounce of speed helps me decode my thoughts with clarity and grace.

I need to be agile, flexible, go anywhere anytime. I need to be minimalist on a convention floor. I need to look professional in front of a client. This laptop over performs in every category. The design of this laptop looks so good with its copper trim and black matte aluminum casing. Not only can I go anywhere.. I want to go everywhere! Coffee shop, Brewery, Diner, Coworking Space, wherever. I don't need to walk in with a heavy backpack, and ask awkwardly for a seat close to a power outlet. The battery life is so good on this thing, they advertise 8+ hours of battery life. I can run on full brightness, with Chrome blaring music in my headphones, with the Unity Editor open for 4+ hours before I have to start thinking about charging it. 

At 4 lbs this laptop is a delight to carry around. This laptop just doesn't get in the way. It doesn't try to be flashy. It simply is the medium through which you view the content you are developing or consuming.

The only problem I have with this laptop is it can get hot near the back underside, when working on my bed. The computer noticeably slows down a bit when it gets hot. To avoid that, I work on surfaces that aid in dissipation of heat.

Many other reviews seem more critical but the honest truth is that if you have a budget for gaming laptops this would be a fine starter for many people.",Kanjimaru,Great Budget Gaming Laptop,2,0,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",5
"Where to begin. Bought this laptop new and had issues from day one. The blue screen of death was a regular problem early on, wifi connection issues everywhere I go, Chrome wouldn't launch properly and caused frequent crashes, and most recently it won't recognize the battery so I have to leave it plugged in (defeats the purpose of it being portable in my opinion). At least it hasn't crashed recently after uninstalling Battlenet, but that was the only reason I purchased this laptop to begin with. Oh, and if you don't pay for the Best Buy warranty you only have 30 days to return which is a problem if you have a busy work schedule involving travel and 10+ hour days. Can say with certainty I'll never buy from Best Buy or Dell ever again.",Matt,Plagued with issues since purchased,5,3,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",1
"Just want to say I have been working and building computers for years. This Dell Gaming Laptop is awesome for the price. I know you have read about the screen which it isn't the greatest but it works. I don't mind the screen at all. Keyboard is really great, it works very smooth. The red color of the lighted keyboard is also a nice touch and not overbearing. Also like the red accents on the black model, haven't seen the red model to see how that looked but the black model is nice.
I ended up getting a second one of these laptops for my kids to put games on and for homework we liked it so well.",jpweather,Great gaming laptop for the price,22,3,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",5
"Just got this today. I am very impressed and ran Tom Clancy The Division at 60 fps and had no issues. The settings were set to low and did a benchmark test within the game. 60.7 frames per second 71% CPU and 84% GPU. I am pleased with the power and quality. I worked for my company in the past that dealt with dell directly for all computing needs. I can say this is a high medium range pc by experience with Dell and their lineups. You can easily turn this laptop into a high end gaming machine as in a entry high end. I plan to throw a 4k screen in the future since the i5 can handle it and GPU. Maxing out the RAM as well and I've got a SSD I'll be adding soon. 
I mainly got this for running scripts and programs in cyber security. I needed something that was modest on the power and of course gaming pushes power in PC. I am real pleased with the setup and I highly suggest you purchase this if you're in question. It's definitely worth the price. Fans get a bit loud but that's expected when running a AAA title. Sound isn't all that bad. fair warning updates right out the box and it'll take you awhile to get into the laptop. I run 300 Mbps internet so my dl wasn't the issue it was windows of course taking it's sweet time installing. I hope this helps anyone interested in this machine.

"Performance wise, this is a great laptop, it covered everything I needed. HOWEVER, I have had a multitude of problems since day one. In fact, I had only had it for less than an hour before I had to return it because there were so many driver issues. The Second one is not fairing much better, because every time I close the lid and reopen it, there is a pattern that pops up on the screen and the only way I have found to get rid of the screen pictured below is to power cycle the laptop (press and hold the power button until it completely turns off, not just sleeps). I looked up online and it seems I am not the only one that is having this problem with Dell Products. I tried updating display drivers, but no luck. Good thing I bought the warranty, because this is going straight to Geek Squad. I will update this Review if the problem is solved.",Jake,Everything is breaking,3,0,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",1
"I purchased this laptop with the intent to play Battlefield 1 and maybe a few other games. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth this laptop operates. Of course, I added an M.2 SATA SSD (256GB) and another 4GB of RAM, but this thing is amazingly fast. There is a backlit keyboard (red), but I wish the keys lit up brighter.Also, the keys are too far back on the laptop surface (in my opinion). Last thing I'm not particularly fond of is the fact that it has a single, long hinge. I LOOOVE the speaker(s) on this computer. They're pretty loud for laptop speakers and produce a very clear sound. There is no optical disc drive (CD/DVD drive), but that's okay with me because most software and multimedia objects are going all-digital anyway. It's a pretty sturdy, heavy laptop so for those who hate toting around a laptop with a little weight to it, this surely isn't the device for you. The battery life has to be one of my favorite features. The battery life lasts about ten hours. It's so great. Another pro is there is only a single screw to remove the back/bottom cover for access to RAM and hard drive (among other little electronic components).",DaVinci,Excellent budget-friendly gaming laptop,1,0,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",5
"I bought this computer to play WoW and work on my writing. So far I've been too distracted by the wonderful graphics and speed of the computer to do anything but play WoW. Woe is me. The battery dies a little fast for my liking during game play. It gets around 45 minutes to an hour before letting me know I need to charge it. On the off chance I'm doing something non-game related, it lasts about 7-8 hours. This includes, Facebook, reading, Googling random stuff, or watching the occasional Youtube video. Nothing too strenuous. 
It also heats up super quick (in a lap or on a table with amazing airflow). Like, 15 minutes, here's some lava in your lap heat. 
The screen is great. I was concerned about it after reading the reviews, but truthfully I prefer it over a lot of the glossy screens you see on computers anymore. This also feels much better on my eyes. 
Anyway, All-in-all, I recommend the computer, just be prepared to deal with a hot base and a short battery which are honestly pretty average not only with Dell, but also with gaming computers in general.",Ralyks,Pretty Nice Gaming Computer,1,0,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 - 1TB + 8GB Hybrid Hard Drive - Black",4
"Great laptop for the price. Solid construction. The laptop feels good on your lap or when carrying it around. Nice rounded edges for a smooth look. Screen is attached wonderfully. 

Internals: Good i5 processor HQ(more wattage than U, more power) 
Decent amount of ram. I added 8 more gb and it runs flawlessly with even 15 browsers open. 

Graphics wise the 1050 is solid for a laptop, but under powered for newer games. I've so far tested CS:GO, Elder Scrolls Online, and BF 1. CS:GO ran perfect on ultra settings, ESO ran quite well and BF 1 had frame rates no gamer I know would complain about. 

Not a lot of USB ports so plan on getting a docking station if you use it at a desk, but it does have HDMI 2.0b 

Did have it connected to 4k monitor for a bit and seemed to run smooth throughout so that is an option as well. 

As expected on a retail pc, prepare to go through some bloat ware.

"It was amazing for the first month but since i left college for my summer break, i have had nothing but problems. For the past 2 months i have gotten upwards of 70 BSODs and i have called Dell to attempt to fix it 3 different times and it still occured. I have even sent the laptop in and was without it for 2 weeks, they ""claimed"" to ""fix it"" but the same BSOD happened when i opened it. Now that i have asked for a refund or even a replacement, they refuse because its past 30 days, even though this is a problem out of my control and i did not cause this. Now i am stuck with this laptop and cannot buy another any time soon because all money is going to my college tuition.

I would also like to mention that some reviews mention a blue screen coming up. I did get one on it, although, I only got it once, updated my drivers, and haven't got one since.

"I was very excited about this laptop after seeing its price tag ($800) and seeing the specs that came with the laptop. However, this laptop is flawed and is a very big disappointment. 

After turning it on for the first time, I setup the PC as normal, and installed some updates that were needed for the system. Within two hours, the updates failed to install and I got a BSOD. I was very frustrated and in disbelief; a brand-new laptop, and I already got a BSOD. The next day, I got TWO more BSOD. Very disappointing.

The hard drive is sub-par, I assume a 5400 RPM HDD. The disk was constantly at 100% usage, bogging the computer down, almost to the point where it wouldn't respond. Although it is a HDD and not a SSD, it's sad.

"The GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti are pretty much this year's go-to GPUs for this price bracket.

It uses a very low quality display compared to other GTX 1050 laptops, last year's Inspiron Gaming model, and other $800+ laptops in general.

"I really like the MSI GS73VR 7RF but there are few things you should know about it.
Let's start with nice ones:
1. Keyboard is probably the best keyboard I have ever seen and typed. Feels very nice, great space between the keys. Steel series what can I say, the best.
2. 17.3"" LCD is looking great with 120MHz 5ms.
3. Dragon Center allows you to do all kinds of stuff. You can change the color of keyboard backlight however you want, you can boost CPU and GPU, MSI tru color lets you choose nice types of LCD backlight (warm/cold). Let's you control CPU/GPU fans which is nice when you do light work on the laptop and want it to be silent.
4. Thin beast GTX 1060 laptop. GPU is great, especially GTX 10 Series that is Pascal GPU Architecture is totally different than the lower series. 0.8 inches thick is really nice.
5. Games run amazing. Battlefield runs great on Ultra settings.

Negatives:
1. LCD need to support G-Sync. I would even pay a little more to have G-Sync in. $1800 should have G-Sync feature built in. Even if it's not there MSI should offer an option to mail the laptop to them so they could add G-SYNC for extra money, a lot of people would want it. For example Asus GL702VM ($1350) and Asus ROG Strix GL702 17.3($1500) laptops have it. MSI should really work on it.
2. SSD that is used on this model is TOSHIBA m.2. I am kinda disappointed that they went cheap on SSD m.2. Instead of puttin Samsung Pro 960 like they did on the same model but with 4k ($2200) they put Toshiba. Can't really complain because it still runs very well but still Samsung would be much better.
3. Software issues at start. First thing is that when you turn on the laptop the first time, all these exclusive features like MSI true color, killer network, dragon center steel engine etc. are missing. The laptop comes with CD where these programs are but the laptop itself doesn't have a CD/DVD reader so it requires external cd/dvd drive. MSI BURNRECOVERY is missing. F3 recovery key is not working on this laptop because it also comes with no hidden recovery partition. When I called MSI customer service and asked about MSI burnrecovery been missing all they said that I would have to purchase disks for $35 which I think is a little greedy on their side. Also you can download all this software on MSI website but still come on guys, $1800 bucks laptop and software is not installed. It's not an issue for me because it's what I do for living, but if it's someone that is not techy that person would have some troubles installing it.
 
Some other useful stuff:
4K displays are not truly nice displays yet. I have returns GS73VE 7RF 4K because it had greenish tint around LCD, be careful when you purchase it and check it out when it arrives. I personally prefer 120MHz 5ms over 4K. This laptops screen is really nice and I am much happier with this one instead of 4K. 
I will post updates if find out about something new about it.
MSI developers/innovators - G-Sync is future of gaming, work on it. If this laptop would have G-Sync that would be #1 selling laptop WW.
Thanks for reading and hopefully there is some use of it for you.

"I've had about 5 laptops over the past 15 years; this is legitimately the first one I'm pleased with. Maybe I've spoiled myself by building my own PCs since I was young, but as a result, I've never been impressed with any laptop's performance. I saw the MSI GE72MVR 7RG on sale at my local Best Buy and grabbed one thinking I wouldn't need to buy another laptop for quite some time.

It turns out I was right. The performance this laptop brings to the table is incredible. The ability to play any game, anywhere, is amazing. I'm extremely impressed with the GTX 1070. I have a 1080 in my desktop and I can't believe how well the 1070 holds up in comparison. Any game I play at home I can take on the road now.

It goes without saying that the laptop is ideal for work-related activities also. If you're using it exclusively for school work or emails, I could see how it could be a little overkill in regards to size/weight... (although I personally love the weight, you can tell it's a sturdy laptop just by looking at it and I don't mind having my system cased in metal) but even if you did get this system just for work, you won't be disappointed. It boots to desktop in about 15 seconds from the time you push the power button, and the Killer NIC built in connects wireless or hardwired in a matter of seconds without any issues.

"I haven't had an HP laptop since 2012, when the larger 17"" Pavilions were out. While I'm not digging the new gaming scheme of the Omen design, I have to admit that the core i7, GTX 1050ti, is exactly what I was looking for in a gaming capable laptop that is under the $1000. The Best Buy sales guy, who sold me this laptop, just knew what I wanted, showed me the HP Omen, and out the door with it in hand. 

After unboxing, first boot up, and about 2 hours of Windows and Nvidia driver updates and it's off running. Runs all my games at all the settings that I am happy with (med-hi). The 128 GB M.2 ssd is alittle small, but can't complain with the 1 GB storage drive. Just reset all my windows settings to have all apps and games stored there instead of the SSD. Speed is good, able to upgrade my RAM to 16GB with very little effort on getting the bottom panel out. Just take your time in unscrewing and unhooking the clips from the bottom panel. I've read others about stripping the bottom screws, and I can see why as it would need a firm grip on my screw driver to unscrew. BE VERY CAREFUL on disconnecting the sata cable from hard drive to motherboard before you take the hard drive out. I was being stupid and just unscrewed and pull the hard drive out....thinking there was enough sata cable slack. There isn't and just pulled the cable right out from the sata port/motherboard. Thank goodness no damage, but just be warned.

Screen is decent, but yeah, it's a 60Hz monitor. For mine being around $880, I can't complain. Would have gone for the 120Hz to get more frame rates in my games, but again....can't complain.

As stated before, not really into the red gaming scheme, but almost every gaming laptop has this theme going, but I got used to it. Not sure I can take it to office meetings though. Sound, web cam, i/o ports are all good, so no issues there. A GTX1060 would have been ideal, but between the 1050 and 1050ti, spend a little more and go for the ti. Battery is good for what is is...3-4 hours regular use and 1 hour when gaming. Screen hinge is a little looser than I like, but doesn't wobble so I'll see when time goes on.

Will purchase this all over again if I have to. If there was a ti version in the HP Power 15t, I might have gone for that one, as it's theme is green and not gaming red, but for the price of a ti card, what the heck. =) Now, if i had to choose between this and the Dell Inpsiron, would still go for the Omen. Maintenance on heat pipes on the Omen looks easier than that of the Dell, mainly because the Inspiron's cpu/gpu heat pipes are hidden under the back panels.",JohnV,It's a great 1050ti laptop.,3,0,"HP - OMEN by HP 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB HDD + 128GB Solid State Drive - HP sandblasted hairline brushing and carbon fiber",5
"When I was doing several searches and looking over just what I needed in a laptop VS what I wanted, I never thought I would have found myself purchasing an HP Omen. This laptop came in at an awesome price for the specs and so far I have yet to be disappointed. It supports what I need it to do. It is my work laptop when I'm not in state. It is my gaming laptop when I am sick. It is my music workstation when I am practicing my piano and keyboard. It is lightweight for me and versatile and not bulky feeling at all. The finish and decoration on it also help set it apart from my other considerations since it comes with some pretty snazzy (I think so) style to it.

What I like:
+ Price for me was perfect (Around $950 after all was said and done)
+ Good graphics card 
+ Strong/Fast OS drive
+ Large storage drive
+ No nonsense out of the box package had me going immediately
+ Makes wife jealous
+ Support for newer and older hardware interfaces
+ Backlit keyboard for night time workings

Things I didn't necessarily like:
- HP means you get ONE recovery disk you can make, after that you have to buy it from them.
- Makes wife jealous

Overall:
I felt this was a very good laptop, especially for the price I got it for. I can play my games, do my work and have music fun. May have to buy the wife one for her birthday so I don't have to keep such a close eye on mine! Ideally I would like to put another 8G of ram into it, but with the 8G it comes with, it's MORE than capable of handling everything I throw at it.

I try and lower my video settings so I can decrease the lag as much as possible, and it does work...only slightly. And then I'm sort of ruining my gaming experience. For something that has been designed mainly for computer gaming, I feel like using this as a regular computer more so. I'd take it back, but frankly I waited to long and I won't get refunded (LOL). But I'm going back in the store to see what the problem may be and if there's anything that can be done/fixed. To end this, do I like it? Yes. And how things have been for me?

As far as performance, it's actually a lot better than I expected. I do a lot of photo/video editing (<30MP/1080P), so I use Photoshop/Premiere/After Effects/Illustrator/etc regularly.

I've been a PC gamer for going on 15 years now, and I didn't really have high hopes that Dell could push out a worthwhile laptop, but I needed a decent gaming laptop because I've got a few trips planned and it sure would be nice to have as my carry around, and a backup should my desktop fail at any point.

It's run every game I play on it at its full 60fps at max settings.

For basic creature comforts, the start time from hitting the power button to typing in your password comes it at a whopping 12 seconds because of the SSD, and even when you're gaming it doesn't get too warm on the lap. The hottest part of the computer, the processor, sits right in the dead center of the keyboard and not over your left knee like most computers I've seen, so even if you're pushing the graphics you don't notice the heat. The keyboard does get warm right in the middle, but it's not too hot at all. It's about the temperature of a cup of coffee that's been sitting out for 30 minutes, warm but comfortable to touch. All in all, exactly as what I'd expect from a high end processor that's flexing its muscle.

The beauty of this guy, though, is the price. There are Asus laptops going for about the same 1100 right now that don't have as good a processor, don't have as much ram, and don't have near the graphics performance of this Dell.

"I have long been skeptical about Alienware computers because of the many reviews out there that warn would-be buyers about their tendency to overheat and fall apart. However, after using this Alienware 13 R3 for several weeks, it's clear to me that either those reviewers are greatly exaggerating, or Alienware has improved their build quality to the point that those reviews are just not applicable to the Alienware 13 R3.

The Alienware 13 R3 is a very good gaming laptop. It fits in a bag designed for 15.6"" laptops comfortably, despite having a significantly bigger than 13"" chassis due to the radiator on the back for the large-ish mainstream GPU inside, the GTX 1060. For its 1080p resolution, the GTX 1060 should be fine for mainstream gaming for years to come, so performance-wise I'm quite satisfied with it. And of course because this laptop is still new, right now the performance is phenomenal.

There is a lot of competition on the compact gaming laptop market right now, and this laptop is right there at the top of what is possible with current technology. I see signs that competitors and even Alienware might eclipse this laptop's compact bang-for-the-buck performance in just a few short months from now with ""Max-Q"" laptops, but right now I'm happy with it, and I got a good deal on it from Best Buy.

So the main things I can recommend on this laptop are that it has a good graphics card, a good enough screen, and a compact enough size that it isn't uncomfortable to lug around in a bag. The touchpad is good, but nowhere near as good as a Macbook's. The keyboard, however, is fantastic -- I love the keyboard so much. The tactile response is delightful and the keys feel very solidly built.

I also like that the screen hinge seems extremely sturdy, so I don't expect to have to run back to Best Buy for a repair on this unit any time soon. The whole laptop just feels solid and well-balanced. It's very satisfying to interact with and doesn't show any indications of weak points. That doesn't mean you can toss it around the house with reckless abandon, but it definitely feels built to handle day-to-day wear and tear for many years.

For the price, this is great stuff. Just be prepared to spend another $800 or so if you want to upgrade it with aftermarket RAM and high-end SSDs for increased storage capacity and multitasking ability.",Aloesees,"Best Alienware laptop ever, great build quality",7,0,"Alienware - 13.3"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Silver",5
"I'm really loving my new Alienware 13 R3, and KUDOS to Best Buy for being one of the few retailers that actually have any Alienware in stock - this is great for people like me who have no patience :) So far, I've upgraded my RAM to 32GB DDR4 @2600MHz and upgraded the SSD to 2TB (this machine takes m.2 [80mm]/PCIe). I love being able to use Tobii and Windows Hello to log in using just my face and I'm very happy that Alienware (aka Dell) reintroduced the illuminated trackpad on the 13"" models. I feel that this machine is well worth the money, especially given all the upgrades available. Compare this unit to Razer and you'll find that you get more for your money and you can do more with Alienware! Razer is all beauty and no brains or substance (I was considering their latest 14"" model)! Alienware, on the other hand, is both beautiful - beauty is in the eyes of the beholder - and has a lot of substance :) Very happy with my decision, which I did after thoroughly researching alternatives including MSI (stealth line), Razer (14""), HP (Omen and Spectre), Dell (XPS and Latitude), Lenovo (Y700-series) and Acer (Predator series). Most important to me was portability (small form factor, minimized bulk) with no sacrifice in capability and power. The Alienware 13 I have has a Core i7 (6th gen.), illuminated keyboard and trackpad, small footprint (less than 5 lbs. a little shorter than a MacBook pro 15""), Tobii aware (not with eyetracking), Full HD anti-glare, and full-sized keyboard). Again, I'm really happy with my decision.",Chaos90,Powerful Machine in a Portable Package,23,5,"Alienware - 13.3"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 512GB Solid State Drive - Silver",5
"I returned my Dell 13 XPS two-in-one because it lacked the graphic card that this laptop has which allows me to do intense gaming and video editing. It was able to handle all that without breaking a sweat. I heard complaints about the Alienware being heavy. In terms of size and weight, I have to say that I much prefer the Dell 13 XPS that I returned. But in terms of power and performance, this Alienware 13 blows the Dell away. Of course, this version costs more so you need to take that into consideration. 
I did not get the OLED version because it wasn't available, but I am saving about $300 with this Full HD display. The only negative is that this display isn't Touch-Screen capable. I assumed that all Windows laptops were touch screens. After a day with the laptop, I decided to keep it. I rarely use the tablet mode anyways.",AChang,Great Laptop!

This laptop is has a second empty M2 slot for expansion (cool) but it uses to 8gb ram chips, filling both ram slots (sucks when I want to upgrade).

The dual camera facial recognition for logging in is lots of fun,and works in just about every lighting condition I've faced so far.

The keyboard took getting used to like any new laptop.

The only downside to being 13"" is no numeric (but I knew that going in). The only thing I wish this machine had was a card reader.

"It's a solid build. I love the design of this machine. Its size allows more ventilation to take place, keeping the laptop cool. The 1060 does its job just fine for games and heavily-graphic required tasks. 
Now the not-so-fun part: the battery life would last about 3 hours, which is rather standard. However, note that if you're more likely to take it outside, you'll have to bring the charger. That means on top of 2.5 kgs of the machine alone, you're bagging about a few more hundred grams of the adapter, adding up the total weight to about 3 kgs.

"This is a pretty decent laptop. I could not find a similar spec laptop for the sale price this one was when I got mine ($1399). Not many (or any?) gaming laptops offer a 4K screen at this price, however Windows 10 does not do well with 4K resolution IMO. If you connect external monitors that are 1080p, you can visibly see the resolution rescaling as windows tries to figure it out when dragging windows from laptop display to monitors. I've also noticed laggy animations with the 4K resolution. I believe this has to do this laptop having discrete intel hd graphics as well as dedicated Nvidia GTX 1060. It has nvidias optimus and I don't think it handles switching between the 2 very well (this would go for any laptop with this setup tho and not specific to this dell). My guess is that the intel graphics are being used for simple windows + tab type animations and that is why there is lag. If I set my display to 1080 resolution things do seem better performance. I also had to return the first laptop because the light bleeding was particularly bad in the top right corner where it was extremely noticeable in many situations. There were some smaller light bleed spots on the bottom but they were not noticeable unless completely black screen. The second laptop I received also has light bleeding in top left and top right corners. I decided to just keep it anyways but this is really sad that there are so many light bleeding problems with these laptops. 

So in summary, the laptop is a well designed and good hardware option for the price, just know there are good chances you will have light bleeding issues with the display and it might seem laggy with 4k resolution. I even noticed that chrome browser seems to have fairly laggy/delayed scrolling with touchpad and mouse in 4k yet somehow Edge browser is smooth. I'm not sure why other than perhaps not all applications are optimized for 4K resolutions in windows 10 either. It does great for gaming at 1080 resolution, you will not notice any performance issues then, so if your main purpose of purchase is for gaming you should be happy with the performance. I wanted the 4K display because reviews online have all stated this panel has much more accurate color reproduction than the 1080 panel, so until windows 10 pushes out updates that handle 4K scaling better, I might just be be happy with the good colors and keep resolution set to 1080 while trying my best to ignore light bleeding in corners.",DurdeeBurger,"Good hardware for price, ok laptop",1,0,"Dell - Inspiron 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 512GB SSD - Matte Black",3

I found out that the Oculus does not work with the 7577 Dell. The HDMI port is not working with the Nvidia card and not allowing enough power to turn on the headset. it allows Sound but not visual. Severally disappointing due to this since the main reason I bought it was to replace my Desktop for VR. 

Over all besides the main selling point saying it is VR ready, the laptop works great with games and applications that require more power. I have 32GB ram due to adding another 16GB stick so there is no reason this should not work.

After getting home and downloading all updates and games, I experienced the exact same issues as I did with the other one. I called the Alienware technical support line and after looking over my computer and deleting and reinstalling some things they said my computer was healthy. my laptop continued to have the same problems after this so I called again. after going through my computer again they said it was running fine even when I told them my strangely low frame rate on games. so I called best buy support and after telling them my frame rate issues they seemed very surprised with my computers problems. I am currently typing on my second unit, I have not yet taken it into best buy to have them look at it, but I have decided to return it for my money back. when I got all my payments in line for this thing and figured out the financing plan after learning I had finally gotten enough money, I nowhere near expected the amount of inconvenience.",modroms,Terrible Experience,36,15,"Alienware - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive - Silver",1

"Out of the box this laptop looks great. Display is great as expected and everything performs well... Minus one key problem.

I was unable to get the nvidia drivers to update. I googled the issue to death, contacted MSI support, NVIDIA support etc. and, after hours on the phone with MSI they recommended sending it back to them indicating it was likely a hardware issue of some sort. Returned it to Bestbuy and, thinking it was just bad luck, had them order me another one.

The second one shows up a week and a half later. Get it out of the box, setup, go to update the Nvidia drivers and, it was a no go. In both instances the nvidia installation indicates it doesn't recognize the hardware. 

So, back to google and MSI forums. One person on MSI forums seemed to think it could be as simple as the hardware id's not being registered through Nvidia. I mentioned that to MSI support and they said that's definitely not the problem. They had me try a few other basic things and, then came back again indicating there's definitely some hardware problem. 

So, if I were you I would STAY AWAY from this laptop until they get it figured out. Games (such as BF1 and in my case the BF5 closed alpha) require a minimum specific version of video drivers so, at some point you could potentially be hosed if you can't get them updated.

"I have had this laptop now for a bit and finally decided to leave a review on it. I have not been able to find a real issue with this laptop.

I can play just about anything on it on high or max settings with little difficulty. It runs fast, updates easily. and have had no issues with it. 

Even under high loads, the fans stay pretty quiet, and the laptop itself doesn't get that hot. And for a thin laptop, the speakers aren't that bad, but I typically use a headset anyway. It is also quick to boot and shut down, even with updates. The storage space it also a plus, with the SSD being larger than some, and a 2TB HDD vs others which usually offer 1TB. 

Pros: Thin, Light, Powerful, easy to use, 4 USB ports, headphone + mic jack, quiet keyboard, full number pad, backlit keyboard, 

Cons: Steelseries software can be buggy at times and annoying to use (compared to Razer Synapse and Logitech Gaming Software); Power plug in weird place (fan accommodation); windows key in weird spot (function key is where Windows key is on a normal keyboard and vise versa);

"Let me preface this by saying this is going back to BB for a full return. I cannot express the level of frustration this device has caused since I was foolish enough to take it on a business trip instead of my business laptop-- which is now sitting in customs awaiting clearance in a foreign country because it is simply not usable-- for anyone. First, it loses the WiFi. No amount of disabling, removing the driver, airplane mode, etc will recapture a functional WiFi device. I believe the Ethernet card/driver is somehow conflicting despite never having had an Ethernet cable plugged in. The only solution is a full restart, and since this occurs literally at random you could be mid project when you can no longer connect to an internet connection. Restarting also has issues since it just spins and spins. I once left it there ""rebooting"" for 15 minutes, nothing. Each and every time requires a forced restart. This includes during Windows updates. For some reason the WU feature on this version of Windows 10 updates and then restarts-- but this computer cannot handle such technical issues so it just goes directly into a restart and then spins and spins. Forced reboot only goes back to the home screen where Windows says, Update!

Other issues include: slow.... slow... slow typing-- even for basic word processing. It will lose your pinned items and won't allow you to re-pin them (I have no idea why). I have the computer on mute and it still makes sounds. The fan spins really hard, but I've skin checked the underside and naturally the keyboard, and it's not hot. It's just spinning, loudly and constantly. The battery saver mode burns through battery. On reviews with low usage, 60% dimmed screen, and light wifi use the battery lasted 4 hours. In my case, on 20% screen, wifi turned off (and couldn't turn it back on without a restart, naturally), and light word processing use I didn't even get 2 hours!! This isn't the 4K screen, a trade-off I originally made for more battery life (oh the irony) and the graphics look terrible.

"Solid construction. I've had it two weeks so far and absolutely love it.

-Very fast. Plays star wars battlefront very well. I didn't know that graphics could look so good on a laptop.
-Very light. I didn't realize how light 3.8 (or around there) pounds is until i held it in my hands. wow.
-Screen is great. I love the matte. Love the angles
-Some reviewers have posted that the fans are loud. I have no idea what they're talking about. But then again, I have mine on a cooling stand with five built in fans so maybe ""loud"" to them is just normal to me lol. It's a gaming laptop...
-Battery can last around 4-5 hours if you are using it for office stuff (3.5-4ish if you're watching a movie or streaming).
-Construction is solid. It doesn't look cheaply made. The logo, while a bit flashy for my taste, definitely had some serious design put into it. 

- The HDMI port is 1.X, not 2.0. If you want to output 4k @ 60hz, you need to use either the miniDP (tv has no miniDP or DP input) or the Thunderbolt 3.0. Speaking of which...
- Thunderbolt 3.0...? It apparently has it, although it's hard to very for myself because I have nothing to test it on! 40 gbps is very attractive and would make for a great external docking station w/ a nice graphics card.. But where in the world can I find a TB 3.0 cable? I get the whole ""future proofing"" thing.. but it's very frustrating that I have a port that I can't use because there aren't any cables for it! Not technically a con... just a tease lol.
- It's a new laptop so it's hard to find other people who have it or who can answer questions about it. Also, MSI doesn't have the latest drivers on their site. I downloaded and installed all the ""updated"" drivers from their website and it ended up rolling back a few things, which then had to be updated again.

A few other things:
- Some people complain that the laptop speakers are bad. Really? If you're listening to laptop speakers, then you're bad and you should feel bad. It's a 14"" 3.something lb GAMING laptop. I wish it didn't have speakers at all. What I CAN say is that the laptop has great bluetooth connectivity and will connect wirelessly to my 7.1 surround sound yamaha receiver. If you can afford a gaming laptop, you can afford a stereo. I also have some nice bluetooth wireless earbuds for when I'm on the road (and also for when I'm at the gym)
- You NEED a cooling station if you're gaming or if you're using the laptop for office work in your actual lap. In other words, do NOT cut off the airflow to the bottom of the laptop (intake vents are on the bottom). For plugged in use, there are a million cooling pads out there with all kinds of fancy lighting and fans. For lap use, I strongly recommend the Targus Lap Chill Map (AWE55US). It only has two fans, but it's cushioned on the bottom and much more comfortable for a movie in bed
-If you try to upgrade the 128gb SSD in the laptop it'll void the warranty. Instead, I recommend buying a USB 3.0 2.5"" SATA III to USB 3.0 docking station and connecting a second SSD to that. Right now I have the OS on my 128GB SSD, movies/DLs/work files on the 1tb HDD, and I have my games on a RAID 0 dual Sandisk 950 pro SSDs going on a Akitio dock through the USB 3.0. You might be thinking to yourself that I'm an idiot for using RAID 0 when I'm getting bottlenecked over the 3.0 USB. And you would be right. I'm still searching in vain for a way cord to connect to that TB3 port. Comment on this review if you can find a way to do this.

Overall, this is a solid gaming laptop for the professional on the go. It has a few holes in its functionality, but those holes are there to serve a greater purpose and to free up room for the sake of performance and portability.",ellapapa,Solid Performance with great style and mobility!,11,0,"MSI - GS40 Phantom 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive + 128GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",5
"I had the chance to use for a couple of weeks at a time, each of all the new (skylake) MSI's GS and GE models. These were the GS60 ($1699), GS40 ($1599) and GE62 ($1499).

I can say with confidence that the GS40 is not a smaller GS60, but rather, a watered down GE62 with a higher mark up. Moreover, the GS40 compromises in aspects which for me, were a deal breaker. I have 5 reasons why I returned it and changed it for a GE62:

1. The mouse pad felt cheap as well. Ok, the Elantech solution is GREAT, very flexible and configurable, but the track itself did not feel solid.
2. The keyboard is NOT (not even close) at the level of the GE62 or the GS60. I can hardly believe is a Steelseries (which I love) product. Putting aside the single-color red backlit, which I really do not care about, it bounces all over the place when you type on it and keys feel just cheap. I am a programmer, so that was a GREAT deal for me.
3. I was playing The Witcher 3 and I thought the machine would catch on fire. The CPU hit 85 Celsius and sos did the GPU. That is WAY higher of what I am used to with the GE62. Even the GS60, which is really thin, handles temperatures nos as good as the GE62, yet way better. That was really concerning.
4. SCREEN BLEED, a HUGE spot on the bottom right and another one on the top left. Don't get me wrong. MSI screens (LG I believe) are AMAZING, but the frame of the bezel, pushes to hard on it, making it to display this really unacceptable effect on a $1600 laptop. Apparently this a common MSI problem, a hit and miss, some are good, some are not as good... it might be time for MSI to round-table this issue with their engineering team.
5. The speakers; they were less than sub-par (yes, you read well, LESS THAN SUB-PAR) at the very least. STILL, the Nahimic (MSI's sound software) solution made a great (positive) difference when enabled.

I ended up returning the GS40 and buying a GE62. Same specs, a 100 dollars cheaper, and a world of difference quality-wise.",Fernando,"Not what I expected, by far ... details inside",11,3,"MSI - GS40 Phantom 14"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive + 128GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum Black",2
"While I am not an avid PC gamer, this is my first gaming laptop. Out of the box, my first impression was how light it was, now I am coming from an older laptop but the gs40 was shy away from 4lbs. The laptop also has a sort of hollow feel to it in a way, which at first kind of bothered me since I was coming from a laptop that felt more solid and sturdier. Down the road I did not mind at all and actually found the housing to be great against heat and also a reason why the laptop is so light. If the material was a metal as opposed to this type of plastic, it would get insanely hot. 

Now heat, yes this laptop will get very hot BUT only if you are playing Video Games, only game I tried was The Division which played phenomenal. FYI you need to have the laptop plugged into the power when gaming or else the game will lag. It has Slow frame rates when unplugged, however I did not try lowering setting which most likely would have solved the lag. While using the gs40 under normal conditions, browsing web/internet/email/youtube ect, the laptop does not produce much heat and remains pretty quiet. Its when you start a PC game that the gs40 turns into a beast, cranks up all the fans and begins producing a lot of heat. On the upside, I feel like it does a great job at dissipating heat for such a small frame but you will definitely want to play video games on a flat table top to allow proper air ventilation and also because it will get hot, I wouldnt use it on my lap when gaming.

Fan noise, the gs40 isnt very quiet when comparing to other notebooks. If you are used to your machine not making a sound when in operation then the gs40 is not for you as she does produce some sound from the fans and an incredible amount of sound when playing a game. 

My favorite thing about the gs40 was the bootup time and speed. I have not timed it but boot up time from pressing the power button to getting into windows is probably no more than 30 seconds. This computer is very fast which is the main reason why I purchased it, it is also upgradable to 32gb of ram.

"You have to treat the grandkids equally. So I decided to buy them each a laptop for Christmas. I wanted it to be a gaming one that could also handle any homework assignment they might encounter. 
 The store didn't have this particular one as a special or anything, but I knew what I wanted to get them anyway. The salesman directed me toward my intended target after mentioning the brand name. They give an assurance where if you find the same item for a lesser price, just bring them the ad and they will match the ad. Try as I might, they had the best price. 
 The laptops got in before the crazy sales the days before Christmas. So I was able to avoid that crowd. Afterwards, they give you the option of setting up a meeting with the ""Geek Squad"" to help set up or answer any questions you might have about the product. So that's good to keep in mind if you aren't very computer savvy and it's a nice free feature that's offered.

"I haven't owned a gaming laptop in a while now. All my laptops up to now were just simple browsing and media computers from Asus, HP or Samsung. I even owned a Chromebook for a bit and liked it. But I've been itching to get a gaming laptop for a while. I do have a gaming desktop and I can remotely connect to it for gaming but it's not the same. There is too much latency. So I started searching for a laptop that would have an i7 processor, at least 16GB of Memory, an Nvidia GTX 1050ti or better and, most importantly, a thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. I also didn't want a tank for a laptop, so a slimmer design would be good.

Well, the MSI GS63VR definitely matches all my needs and even exceed them. I'm going to organize my review into sections like I/O, design, keyboard, storage, and more:

- Design: MSI managed to make a slim metallic rectangle look really good. That ""brushed"" metal is very nice to the touch. I like how simple the top of the laptop is with the MSI logo and everything. The bottom has this soft material which will lift up the laptop a bit and transfer less heat to the surface it's on. I don't recommend using this on your lap. It also protects the bottom of your computer from being scratched by whatever material might be on the table.

- Display: This model has a 1080p Matte finish TN display. It is not the best looking one, and if anything, might be the worst part of this computer. The colors seemed a bit flat and no matter how you tweak the settings in the MSI True color software, it just doesn't look right. The display is also only 60hz and does not support G-Syn which is a bummer, because I have to turn on V-Sync in order to reduce screen tearing. At least, you do get the option to connect an external display or more and all your issues will be gone.

- Keyboard: The keyboard is a full sized Steelseries keyboard and it is one of the best laptop keyboards I've ever used. the keys have a nice feel when pressed and it just makes you want to type an essay (or in my case, this review). There is back-lighting and yes, it is RGB. Unfortunately, the lighting is divided in zones (3 of them) so you won't be able to do some of the cool ripple effect that Razer keyboards do. I can't complain too much because it is still a really good looking keyboard and the lighting is always a bonus.

- Trackpad: The trackpad looks nice, and has a red metallic rim around the inside of it that gives it a nice touch (heheh...) but using it isn't so pleasant. I don't really plan on using it much but coming from a Chromebook Pro, I did really like using the trackpad on that one and the gesture were really intuitive. You can change some settings using the Elan Smart-Pad software but I haven't been able to fix the mouse acceleration, which bothers me the most. If you have a mouse, I suggest you use it over it.

- Speakers: You'd think that the speakers were under those grills, right adobe the keyboard but those are for the cooling fans. The speakers are located under the unit, towards the front of it. They're not the greatest but if you need to watch a video, do it in a quiet place. Even at max volume, they are still very quiet and you will miss out on whatever you are listening. Either use a portable speaker or some headphones if you want a louder sound.

- I/O: If you think that because this laptop is thin, it won't have more than two USB ports, you are wrong. This laptop has 3 USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a Gigabit Ethernet Port and audio/mic (separated) jacks on the left. On the right, you have the charging ports, a Mini Display port, an HDMI port, a USB-C port that also supports Thunderbolt 3 (yay!) and a USB 2.0 port (what?). So gone are the needs for a USB hub, an USB to Ethernet adapter or an SD card reader! It's all in there already! If you're wondering why I'm so happy about the Thunderbolt 3 port, it's because you can do so much with it. You can connect up to 3 display through that port alone but more importantly, down the road, when your expensive laptop isn't so high-end anymore, it will let you connect an external GPU that is MUCH beefier than the one inside and not be restrained by the small airflow and thermal throttling that a slim laptop can suffer from. Thunderbolt 3 lets you future proof your laptop a bit. As for the USB 2.0 port, I'm not sure why it's there other than MSI assuming that all you're going to plug in to it, is a mouse anyways. I mean, they're not wrong since it's what I'm doing but it would have been nice to have USB 3 all around. There is a webcam on the top of the screen but it is 720p and it is really bad. I wouldn't recommend using it for anything more than a simple video call.

- Battery life: Don't expect this laptop to last very long. I get maybe an hour to two out of it on battery with regular usage or light gaming. You'll probably want to be plugged in anyways since you won't get the full performance. The charger that comes with the laptop is very wide but also flat. It takes up quite a bit of space in my backpack but I can manage.

- Internals: If you ever dare to open this laptop (it's not that hard), you'll be pleased to know that a lot can be upgraded. You can replace the SSD drive with a better one, and even upgrade the HDD to a 2TB. The computer comes with 16GB of RAM in the form of 2x8GB sticks. You can eventually upgrade it to 32GB by purchasing 2x16GB sticks but I suggest waiting until prices go down. Also, the RAM slots sit underneath the keyboard, on the other side of the motherboard and reaching it is a bit harder than the rest. I suggest watching a disassembly video or guide before going in.

- Software: This laptop comes with Windows 10 Home, but is full of Bloat. Holy cow. Why is Norton still a thing? I can see why other reviewers recommend you wipe it clean and start over. Not only is it full of bloatware, there are also a lot of MSI app running at all time. You need one for the trackpad, one for the keyboard, one for controlling the Wifi, bluetooth and other connections, one for tuning the display, one for the network adapter and, finally, the MSI dragon center, which monitors and controls just about everything else the other apps I mentioned don't. If you get this laptop, I suggest to do a clean install on it.

- Performance: This model comes with a GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of GDDR5 Video RAM. You can throw almost anything at it at max settings and it will run it. I've tried Overwatch, Rocket League, Battlefield 1 and CS:GO so far and have not had any issues with any of them running at the highest setting. I did notice that the laptop was getting ridiculously hot when playing and the fans were getting louder but another reviewer suggested to underclock the CPU, as it is getting too much power. I downloaded the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility and set the voltage to -0.100V. After that, the temperatures were much lower during gaming session without a change in performance (at least I couldn't notice).


I think I covered everything. This laptop is very powerful, and with the right tweaks, will keep cool under heavy load. It has a nice keyboard but an okay display and overall looks really good design-wise. I just wish it was a bit cheaper. This is the first time I've spent close to $1500 on a laptop. And I did it twice.

"I've been building desktops for years and never really had a need for a high performance laptop and I also have an issue with the concept of something that gets outdated as fast as a laptop because there are limited possibilities to upgrade important systems (such as the processor and graphics cards). Recently I've been doing a lot of traveling so I took the plunge and brought this bad boy home. MSI gaming laptops get very good reviews overall, I had not seen the reviews on this particular unit before I bought it but after only a few days use I'd say this is another winner for them. By current 2017 standards this machine should run any currently released game pretty well (I play black desert online in high graphics mode) and the thunderbolt 3 interface adds a whole bunch of options for extra displays etc. The multiple USB 3 ports are great (and are backwards compatible with usb 2 devices). One of the things that attracted me the most to this machine is the ""excellent"" built in steel series keyboard. No other laptop that I've seen lately has such a nice feeling keyboard and the color changing keys is just an added bling bling. The keyboard also apparently can do macros but I haven't had a chance to play with that yet. The thin metal case just screams ""firari"" at you when you first see it and pick it up. For all the power in this machine it is surprisingly light. The keyboard is excellent the screen is better, I just can't find many bad things to say here. As always when you get a new computer you can count on many hours of upgrades both to the machine and windows, then of course you get to download your games and other stuff (does anything even come on a dvd anymore??). The machine comes standard with 16 gig installed, the guy that sold me the machine said he didn't think it could take anymore ram and they don't say anything about the issue in the book but from what I have read and seen the motherboard does have a second ram slot it is just not a simple matter to get to it. The ram slots are under the keyboard and the only way to get to them is to remove the bottom/back of the laptop and take out the motherboard. Anyone used to building machines and changing out laptop keypads etc. should not be too afraid of this but as these are high performance 16 gig ddr4 chips they are still a little on the expensive side (and a person concerned with best performance may want to have a pair of the same chip). I don't currently need the upgrade but when the RAM chips come down in price I may just go ahead and get one and install it as more RAM is never a bad thing. This machine has several cooling fans for the cpu and the gpu as well, no matter what you do..heat will always be one of the limiting factors for a high performance laptop just because it's so hard to deal with so much heat in the small space of a laptop case, those stands with the extra fans do seem to help but you can still expect a lot of heat on the bottom of the machine. The MSI tools include a temperature monitor and the ability to adjust your fan speeds etc. At full blast the fan noise is noticeable but it doesn't bother me at all as I use a headset for voice chat etc. You want your components cool, screw the noise. If you've never heard of USB C that's a sort of new thing, the google nexus 5x and some of the newer google phones use USB C, the main advantages are usb 3 communication speed and the socket/cable is not keyed you can plug it in any direction no issues. The C bus can also provide more than 5v of power over the cable and is also backwards compatible to other usb varieties with adapters etc. This is a very expensive laptop but the top end specs should mean it will last longer than a machine with lower specs going into the future. This model has two sata plugs for a hard drive and a small ssd to make windows load much faster, etc. From what I have seen so far you cannot access the contents of this smaller ssd by default (MSI probably did that for a reason). In theory you could pull out that small ssd and install a larger ssd or another old school spinner drive. Upon login you use the MSI set password not the windows password that is usually set when you log into another windows machine--personally I'd appreciate it if they'd give me the choice so it's a bit easier to remember the password. Yes, this was a heckuva lot of money but you'll spend as much on an apple book with probably lower specs than this one or an ipad with all the bells and whistles. You will be glad you made this purchase rather than dealing with a lower spec machine that cost less. it's sort of amusing that in the past games were written with the ability to run on lesser hardware because gamers tended to be poor, these days that trend seems to have totally reversed!",suem,Pricey but worth it....beautiful,9,1,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",5
"I'm not going to go in great detail with a review about the obvious as you can simply read others reviews about this laptop all over the internet. I will say one thing about this laptop - it's a powerhouse. It can handle anything that you throw at it at 80+ fps with everything maxed out.

Like I said above, rather than write a full review, I'm going to point out some ""what you gotta do's"" when you buy this as well as point out some possible ""deal breakers.""

**To the people who are thinking about purchasing this or already have it and are noobs - pay close attention to the following...

There are 3 things that you want to do with this as soon as you buy it.

1. Replace the 1TB hard drive. It' will get rid of the lag that you will hear people complaining about that have this model and the previous 6RF model. 

2. Do a fresh install of Windows 10. Wipe all of the MSI junk and bloatware off of this laptop. You're stupid if you don't. Sorry to be harsh but if you'd prefer to keep the MSI junk just re-download it after you preform a fresh install. You'll thank me later.

3. Undervolt the CPU. As with most gaming laptops, the CPU is fed too much unnecessary power and causes temps to jump into the mid 90's while gaming. If you think this is OK then you're nuts. Simply go on youtube and search how to undervolt the i7 7700hq and download either program and undervolt the core by 0.100 volts. You'll notice that the CPU never goes over 85 celsius. 

Also, for those that want to know - these are the temps that I'm getting after doing everything mentioned above. 
Idle GPU(nvidia) - 50 celsius
Idle CPU - 45 celsius(down from 55-60 celsius before undervolting)

**Also, if you've ever heard of coil whining, be prepared to become it's best friend owning this laptop. There's an ambient yet sometimes annoying whining noise coming from the i7 kaby lake CPU when you have the power setting set to high performance. Set it to balanced to reduce the noise. Also, after undervolting it will also reduce the noise a little more so that you won't hear it anymore unless you try to hear it, if that makes any sense.

"TL;DR: It's great - buy it I'm glad I did.

I've had this laptop just over a day and I'm thrilled with it. What's there to complain about in a thin, light laptop that boots up faster than I can get ready to use it?

While a day isn't enough time to have really put it through its paces and see how it performs in all situations, it's been doing great so far. From basic surfing and email to some coding work and gaming it's handled everything flawlessly. The only time I heard the cooling fans was while gaming, and that was a low sound that was not annoying or disturbing in any way.

While I play a lot of games, I don't usually go for machines with extra lighting/LEDs/etc, so my expectation was that I would be turning off the colorful backlighting on the Steelseries keyboard. Fast forward to today, it's still on. It looks great, and when I turned it down (the brightness is adjustable) or off I found myself missing it. The software to customize the lighting looks like it'll be really useful if I feel like changing from the default lighting that I'm currently using.

Speaking of the Steelseries keyboard, it works great. Good tactile feedback, solid movement, and the sound is satisfying in that you get the audible feedback you expect without it being too loud. The keys are stable - not mushy. There are a few odd bits, like the right hand shift key being a little small so I'm having to focus on hitting it while getting used to this keyboard. The zero on the keypad also led to a few mistakes as I'm used to a double-wide zero key on a full size keyboard. Again, it's just a small difference to get used to.

I'm really happy with the screen. It's bright and crisp, very responsive, and hasn't shown any problems with the games I've played. Outside of gaming, pages are clear and easily readable when browsing the web, reading email, or coding.

Performance overall is very quick, including both the SSD and regular hard drive. I haven't noticed any delays related to their performance.

Similarly the Wi-Fi interface has been performing great. I've been installing software and games without a wired connection and it hasn't felt slow at all. I'm sure doing it with a wired connection would have been faster, but the speed I was able to download them at was more than satisfactory.

There's only two small things I wish I could change. I would prefer that the MSI logo on the cover didn't light up, but that's really minor. The other - which I knew beforehand but chose to overlook - is the placement of the power cord jack. The middle of the right hand side is odd, but at least it's a right angle connector so it doesn't get in the way.

All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase of this laptop.",TechTock,We have a winner!,22,1,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",5
"I have had this machine for nearly 2 weeks now. Picked it up on sale. The form factor and build quality are really great for this price point, especially on sale.

The performance and specs of this laptop is really good for this price point, I have no issues there at all. Plays everything I need it to at High to Ultra settings with great frame rates. Supports my Oculus Rift with no extra cable adapters (I have the 3 sensor setup). 
The laptop runs a little warm while gaming but this is pretty typical in a gaming laptop with these specs. Fan noise is not too bad at all in my opinion.

This machine could have been a home run in price/performance. Best Buy/MSI really pooched this machine badly with the display.

There are lots of reviews so I won't get into to many details other than to let you know the reasons I will moist likely be returning this gaming laptop.

1) Sound is fairly weak. It is passable and I could actually live with it, especially since I prefer to game with headphones anyway. 

2) The vents on the bottom of the machine are very flimsy. If you are not careful when picking the laptop up, especially one handed, you could easily break the plastic grills, they are just too thin.

Those two items I could have lived with, the show stopper here is the display! By FAR!

3) THIS IS THE DEAL BREAKER

This is by far the worst TN panel I have ever seen... anywhere!
Its really sad too, because for literally only a couple of dollars more tham this panel costs them MSI cold have outfitted this machine with a decent IPS display. I would gladly pay an additional $50 or more for the better display.

I have a feeling MSI ended up with a stockpile of these junk TN panels and they dumped them on Best Buy.

I have used many TN panels and IPS panels through the years and I have never seen anything this bad on a modern computer. Colors are washed out and the viewing angles are awful. So bad in fact that you cannot even find a decent viewing angle sitting directly in front of the machine. This is not an exaggeration at all, this panel is just miserable to look at.

I really wanted to like this laptop but I just know I will kick myself for thinking I could live with the horrible display.",tmeidinger,"Could be nearly perfect for the $, BUT....",1,0,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",3
"I have the 1080p screen model of this laptop with the 128gb ssd and 1tb hard drive. Following the suggestions many reviewers had here I did a clean install of windows 10 and manually installed Dragon Center to get rid of any bloatware. The computer was running fine for a month until red splotches started forming around the edge of the screen. It became progressively worse until one day a giant red and purple splotch was in the corner. I never left the screen on for extended periods of time on a still frame so I don't think this is screen burn, and even if it were the laptop is only a few months old it shouldn't have any. The splotch also moves around and spreads out over time, and if I press it with my thumb it clears out before coming back to place. The screen has also 
 started coming out of the metal shell, I think the glue came off. Luckily MSI has a warranty and they said they would fix it, but the repair center is in California and I live on the east coast. They want me to pay for shipping over to them, wait about a MONTH for repairs, and then wait for it to ship back. I have work and classes so I can't afford to be laptopless for two months right now, I may have to buy a third party screen. Other than the horribly installed screen this is actually a great laptop.

"As most of you know, the search for a new gaming laptop can be agonizing, taking months to research and by the time you make up your mind, a whole new batch of better, faster laptops is released, so the process starts anew...
I am the kind of person that can't buy based on specs alone, I also have to know how it feels.
So I traveled to several stores to try out the different brands and models. Some felt huge, heavy and ungainly (Alienware), some felt ""plasticky"" (HP Omen), some were blah ( ASUS Rog)...
But when I got to the MSI, I had to stop and stare.
Then I picked it up and looked at it from every angle, trying to find fault.
The keyboard felt great, the weight was just right.
The screen, sharp.
I was pretty sure I had picked a winner.
I almost bought the predecessor that didn't come with the SSD and I'm glad I waited, this version is extremely fast to boot and start games, no more 100% disc issues.
Then I got a coupon for $150 student discount.
I couldn't get to the store quick enough!
It plays all the new, hot games at ultra setting with high FPS.
All I can say is go to the store and try it, you'll buy it!
It feels like a precision crafted instrument, metallic, not plastic.
Seriously, try one of these before you buy anything else.
I'm not going to bore you with the specs because they are already available online. These are strictly my impressions and I am in no way affiliated with either Best Buy or MSI.

"I purchased this laptop over a MacBook Pro. I just couldn't justify the specs vs price of the MacBook. I use Adobe CC daily, editing photos, video and with graphic design. I am not a gamer. I also purchased this after returning the new Dell XPS laptop. I had a number of issues with the XPS, though I liked certain things as well. One thing is that 4K monitors on laptops are problematic. That's all I'm going to say about that. This machine is sleek and attractive. This is my favorite keyboard that I've ever used on a laptop. Only thing that I'm not krazy about are the buttons on the trackpad. I use a Logitech thumb roller mouse now so no big deal. It's still a usable trackpad. I run the heck out of this machine and it handles what I throw at it. The matte screen might not be for everyone, but I like it. I often work with this laptop on my thighs with my knees in the air while on a bed, this machine can push some heat, so make sure you have long enough shorts or pants on so that your skin is not directly touching the machine. I do like the felt bottom design. It helps with the heat. The extra HD is awesome. I utilize the heck out of it and don't know how I ever survived with a single hard drive in a laptop. I still use outboard hds as well. The led lights on the keyboard are customizable. I have mine all set to red. Makes it easy to work in the dark. The touch and feel of the keyboard is excellent. This laptop is a bit wide for some, but suits my taste well. If you're looking for a laptop with high specs, this is a good sleek machine. Though I mentioned heat with this machine, please note MSI has some of the best tech as far as air cooling goes in laptops. Other machines are worse!",Peeps,High Spec Laptop That has Great Feel,14,6,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",4
"After owning an MSI GS63VR, and working with the various models they offer, I have mixed feelings about this particular model (252).

PROS:
-7th Generation i7 is powerful and smooth
-Solid build quality
-Thin and lightweight design
-Lightning fast performance after bloatware is disabled
-GTX 1060 powerful enough for graphic intensive games
-16 GB RAM DDR4
-Solid State and Hard Drive

CONS:
-The screen on the ""252"" model is very low quality compared to the ""228"", ""229"" and ""230"" models. The viewing angles are poor and the colors are washed out. 
-The solid state drive is SATA instead of the NVme drives on the ""228"", ""229"", and ""230"" models. Although fast, this means 1/3 the read/write speeds, noticeable to those working heavily with audio/video.
-Bloatware makes it slow at first, must delete unnecessary apps for optimal performance.
-Battery life is lacking.

The screen on the ""252"" was difficult to look at for extended periods. If you're going to be using an external monitor often, this may not be an issue, but if you'll only be using the built in screen be sure to try it out at the store. Best Buy also sells similar models but with better screens and faster solid state drives for a bit more money. Overall, all of the GS63VR models offer great performance, but be aware of the differences in screens and solid state drives.",SoCalTech33,Incredible laptop with a poor screen,39,8,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",3
"Yeah, it doesn't have an optical disk drive, or even a bay for one. That was the only thing i was second guessing before purchase. But now that i have it, i couldnt care less. Why? Because im getting over 60fps @ 1080p with everything on ultra (minus hairworks) on The Witcher 3! On a freaking laptop! If you're a laptop gamer like me you know how awesome that is. Plus this beast has a port on the back that allows you to hook up a Graphics acceleration box (sold separately) that you can put a full sized desktop GPU inside to use instead of the on board 980m. Not that i have any money left now, but when this thing starts chugging along and getting to that dangerously low <30fps state years from now, i can just upgrade the GPU and keep on trucking on this thing! No more dropping another 2k on a whole new system every 3-4 years! The speakers are top notch (Powerful little subwoofer inside), the LED bling is customizable is tons of ways, the large SSD makes loading times minimal. Even in Fallout 4!

"I have owned many gaming laptops. The last two I owned were from Asus and while they were great, they are just in a different league from the alienware.

This model came with a 256g PCIE SSD. I ordered a second one and configured a raid 0 stripe, so my boot volume is 500g PCIE raid 0. Very fast. In addition I replaced the 1tb hdd with a 1tb sata drive for raw storage. 

This model supports the external graphics amplifier. It is a must have. i put a AMD 390x in the amplifier and can play Doom on ultra settings. Also having the amplifier future proofs the laptop as newer FULL LENGTH cards can be put in.

The onboard 980m can play doom at near ultra settings maxed out, but as with ANY laptop without upgradeable graphics, it was doomed from the day of purchase. Having an upgradeable external enclosure helps a lot with keeping my purchase from becoming outdated.

The build quality is excellent and the keyboard is a 10. The track pad is GOOD but not the same as a MAC... The Macs simply have the best track pads in the industry.

Upgrading is very easy on this model. Flip over and take a screw off.

Compared to a lot of other gaming laptops this one is surprisingly really really light. Just at 4lbs. Only issue i had was that it does run a little warm underload( gaming for more than 2 hours).

"Overall great gaming laptop. It's a very powerful and lightweight laptop, and it takes care of my CAD and Gaming needs perfectly, with high FPS counts and almost no lagginess. Few cons would be the display (It's honestly not great at all, you tilt your head slightly upward and all of a sudden colors start to wash out) and the amount of bloatware pre installed that lags your system (You can still uninstall these, but this is a pain). Battery is also not great, but Nvidia Optimus Technology helps a lot (Switches between Intel HD and Geforce to save battery).",FVayne,Good Balance between Performance and Size,1,0,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",4

Bought this laptop because I really liked the way it looked with a compact design yet powerful capabilities. It had 6gb of VRAM ensuring future compatibility in gaming. Unfortunately all it's great qualities were nullified by the poor quality of the display. Just slightly tilting your head would cause areas to darken and even at maximum brightness the display did not seem bright enough. It's a great laptop if you can get past the display issues but I ended up exchanging this one for another laptop.,BigLoui,Great laptop poor display,2,1,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",3
"I bought this laptop two weeks ago and I enjoy it everyday. 
I play a wide range of things from Ffxiv all the way to Nier Automata. I am able to play every game in Max setting in 1080p. I really havent tried to play anything in 4k or any higher resolution then what is on the display. 

portability is really the biggest winner of this laptop, i canr bring this anywhere from school to home or to a friends house for a Lan Party.

The only real two downsides and these are most common can be heat and battery life. But this is a gaming laptop heat is going to happen and battery life is affected greatly by the i7 processor, Ram and graphics card. 

Even with the downsides I think this is the best laptop for the size if you're looking for a portable gaming laptop

"On paper, this laptop is outstanding. It's light and thin, and yet it holds a 6GB GTC 1060, core i7 7700HQ processor, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, a 256GB PCIE solid state drive, and a 1 TB spinning disk. It's a good price for all that hardware. It was able to run the games I tried on it completely maxed out, including Doom 2016 and Metro Last Light. The fan noise wasn't too bothersome, and it didn't matter at all anyway, since I was using headphones most of the time.

The problem here is the screen. This is a cheap TN panel with a viewing angle so poor that it distorts colors even when looking directly at it from a normal sitting distance. The slightest head movement makes the distortion noticeable. The included color calibration app does little to improve the mess.

I was happy to play some games on it. But after going back to my desktop screen, and then coming back to this laptop, it was basically unusable.

"No matter what I’m trying to do, I have no problems on this laptop. I would recommend a cooling fan, the bottom gets pretty warm sometimes and I have to put a blanket or something underneath to shield my thighs. The speed and response time are great. It’s very quiet. From a complete shut down, mine loads up within seconds. Also, I love the lights on the keyboard and all the different programs that I can sync them to. It pairs perfectly to all of my music! Not having a cd reader is a bit of an inconvenience but has been easy enough to work around.

Now for the cons it does come with plenty of bloatware you can easily uninstall whatever you will not be using and that is that. also battery life is not the greatest I can usually get close to 2 hrs of gaming out of one full charge. just make sure you bring your charger with you and you are set.",remix405,looking for a slim gaming laptop this is it!,4,0,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",4
"The price for this model easily makes it the best bang for the buck--until you get it home and see how awful the display panel is. Apparently, MSI makes a special model of this laptop just for BestBuy, with a low-quality TN panel instead of the IPS panel found on other versions of the GS63. There was just no good tilt angle I could find that didn't wash out the blacks to dark grays, or blow out the bright colors. The various color settings in the MSI app were no real help. After struggling for three hours to get a usable picture, I gave up and returned it for an Alienware 13 R3. 

It's a real shame, too. The laptop was otherwise great. SSD boot times were fast, the GTX1060 churned out 60fps on Fallout 4, it was lightweight, and looked good without being ridiculously flashy. Plenty of ports, decent keyboard, although the speakers left a lot to be desired. But the useless screen killed all of the pluses for me. You shouldn't have to take a $1600 laptop straight to a repair shop and replace the stock screen with something usable before you take it home. If you can find one that doesn't have ""-252"" at the end of the model number, it's an excellent laptop. Unfortunately, since that's BestBuy's specific model, you won't find a different one there. (Also skip the ""-001"" model with the 6th Gen CPU. Last year's exclusive Best Buy model, same bad screen.)",DuncanDoenitz,"Bad screen, otherwise great",12,7,"MSI - GS Series Stealth Pro 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD - Aluminum black",2
"As stated above my various different reviewers this laptop is a powerhouse. The bloatware truly will slow it down as with any store-bought laptop and removing it all is simple just do a fresh windows install. Make sure to just have an external HDD or flash drive w/8gb available. There is all kinds of posts online about how to do it and it makes a huge difference. Second is the undervolting, it is so simple to do with the Intel XTU app which can be downloaded. Other then that replacing the 1tb HDD isn't a must right away but can be done down the road. I was choosing between the ASUS ROG and Eluktronics models. I couldn't pass up the slick look of this laptop and being able to buy it in store made a huge difference. As for the screen I cant tell the difference between IPS and this FHD model. 10/10 Would recommend.
