I dont care for this chromebook at all,1,6,"Overall my experience with this chromebook was very bad. The case feels cheap, and the keys dont type well. The trackpad also didnt perform well at all. I would tell most people to look for something with better fit and finish. Not a good chromebook. Cheap, poor quality, and not good.","Acer - Chromebook 14"" Chromebook - Intel Celeron - 4GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Sparkly silver",21,James
"Solid, reliable, powerful",5,9,"This computer is not exciting or sleek, but it is a solid, reliable, proven machine. I'd used Thinkpads at work for years, and found them to be reliable and rugged, but this one is a world apart - it retains those traits, but is also much more capable (i7 processor, 16 gb DDR4 ram), faster (solid state drive, Windows 10), a very quick NVIDIA videocard (not chipset built into the motherboard) and nicer to look at (larger display, finer resolution. I especially like the multitude of ports it comes with; many USB, a USB-C, the upgraded DCIM video out, and the old style ""docking station"" port on bottom of machine (as opposed to more commonly found USB port replicator connections). And, the battery is user-replaceable (and higher capacity batteries are available). This is an old-school laptop, not the sleek 'toy' style tablet computer that is becoming popular; you don't buy this because it's nice to behold, you buy this because you want/need the power it offers, and the flexibility all those ports gives you (probably twice as many ports as the tablet computers offer). 

There is one feature I kind of regret, and that is the keyboard's 'off-center' placement. It is a fully featured keypad, complete with the 9-key number pad, arrow buttons, etc that you'll find on a desktop keyboard. That forces the center of the QWERTY keyboard off to left of center of the screen. Other reviewers noted this, and I'd dismissed them as whiners, but now that I'm using it, I do find it a bit disconcerting at times. But when used as would normally be used, that is sitting on a port replicator alongside a second larger display, full-sized keyboard, mouse, etc all plugged into the replicator as intended, it becomes a non-issue. They keyboard is otherwise outstanding; good key travel, 2-level lighting, good 'touch' (although not as wonderful as the old ""IBM touch"", sadly no longer available from anyone/anywhere). 

Bottom line - if you're looking for a machine that is reliable, very powerful, flexible, and built to outlast the technological rat-race for a number of years, you won't do better. If all you want is something that looks good at Starbuck's, well, go for one of the touch-screen ""tablet-puters"".

Good computer once Geek Squad cleaned it up,4,12,"The specs on this computer are excellent compared to what's currently available at this level. The hardware itself merits five stars so far and currently works fast and well. One of the only 2-in-1s with an i7, 16gb, and Nvidia dedicated graphics. However Lenovo ships it with enough junk software and out-of-date drivers that the computer had several frustrating operating problems at first. It took the Geek Squad and I spending several hours over two days cleaning and updating to fix. I came very close to returning the computer after the first day remoting with the Geek Squad was unsuccessful. But I tried a second day remoting with them until the persistent troubles were addressed. This is not a Geek Squad plug, and they were not perfect, but do get points for persistence. Details below for the benefit of others. 

One particularly bad problem was that when plugged into Lenovo's proprietary docking station, which is designed for this very unit, the computer would not reboot, instead freezing when rebooted, requiring unplugging the docking station and then doing a hard reboot. The Geek Squad did all sorts of things that made the unit work faster but still couldn't fix this docking station reboot issue. Ultimately, after all sorts of other cleaning and updates, I suggested to Geek Squad reinstalling the USB drivers for the keyboard and mouse. That final step fixed the reboot issue. But these were not obscure pieces of equipment. They were both standard Logitech items that work fine on my other computers, such as Dells and another Lenovo Thinkpad that isn't 2-in-1. I also tested a Microsoft USB keyboard to make sure it wasn't a Logitech thing, and sure enough the Microsoft keyboard also didn't work.

Lenovo should address these problems immediately in both its computer and the related proprietary docking station. I noticed that reviews of the docking station show other folks are having trouble with the docking station on related Lenovo computers and returning. Probably these folks just assumed the docking station doesn't work rather than spending several hours over two days with the Geek Squad trying different things to find solutions. 

As for Geek Squad itself I also give them a 4 star. It would have been 5 star except for one very frustrating thing. On the first day I ran out of time and so had to resume the next day. But the next day the first intake person had no ability to pick up where the specialist left off the day before, and the new specialist also had to start from scratch, so I lost nearly another hour watching two people on the second day repeat everything done on the first day. Since all of this occurs by chat, the Geek Squad should have been able to read what happened the day before and pick up from there rather than starting over. 

I hope this review helps others, and leads to Best Buy, Lenovo and Geek Squad making appropriate improvements. I've been using computers for years, never had a problem like thIs, never needed Geek Squad for any other computer, and was very persistent here. The typical buyer lacks the time and energy to go through all these steps, and should not have to with any computer, let alone a premium product.","Lenovo - 2-in-1 14"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA Quadro M500M - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black",2,GUESS

TERRIBLE!!!: HP laptops and technical support are,1,14,"TERRIBLE! HP laptops and technical support are terrible. DO NOT BUY THEIR COMPUTERS AND DEFINITELY DO NOT buy their warrantee packages. they DO NOT know how to fix their own computers; they do NOT honor their warrantees; their laptops start having problems within 6-9mos; and they will NOT be able to fix them. their TECHNICAL support people will give you the run around around and around; even if you send the unit to their center, it will come back not fixed and then they will give you the run around over and over again. 

I contacted and tried to work with their SmartFriend, Level 2 technical support, and no luck. more poor service and run around. and then I contacted their CORP HEADQUARTERS and what they call their ""EXEC CUSTOMER SERVICE"" and more poor service, no resolutions and round and around problems with them.

Exactly what I was looking for,5,0,"I bought this small laptop because it fits the TSA size restrictions and also because I really wanted something portable and I didn't need anything with a lot of bells and whistles. I also wasn't really interested in a laptop with touch screen features. This is a small, basic laptop that works great. Before I bought it I was a little concerned with some of the other reviews which mentioned slow operating speed and/or problems with the battery but I haven't had any issues. My large laptop has an i7 processor so naturally this is slower but I don't think it's all that slow and it works for the basic functions I wanted, namely internet and word processing. As for the battery, I followed the instructions that said to fully charge and discharge three times and I haven't had any problems. I also like the flat black finish.","Acer - TravelMate 11.6"" Laptop - Intel Celeron - 4GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Black",0,migarto

Impressive receiver,3,0,"The new Marantz receiver is better than my old Pioneer. It provides better separation between individual music elements.

Lightweight Powerhouse,5,6,"Staying with the trusted IT guy’s “spend at least $600 and buy a solid state drive” recommendation, this laptop did not let me down. Two months into ownership, I’ve performed video editing and basic user level tasks, never once seeing this machine flinch. It does not appear to have user serviceable RAM from every note I’ve read, and unlike these easy-access underbody panels my old ProBook had, this unit is screwed together tight as a drum. In comparison to my 4540 ProBook, it is a bit flimsier. My son habitually sets various toys, foods, or beverages on it and I worry about the screen’s integrity of he gets excited and starts slapping it, toy in hand. It has held up well so far. The screen casing is a plastic textured matte finish, as opposed to my previous plastic polished and brushed finish. As such, it has incurred several scratches already while the ProBook shows little damage. 
Performance wise, it boots from sleep to PIN screen to ready in under ten seconds. Every time. The multitasking is unparalleled. I was reluctant to purchase the smaller 256GB SSD when I was replacing a 500 GB 5400 SATA but keeping all my storage on my NAS makes up for that, especially with everything running gigabit connections. My purchase criteria included Win 10, gigabit Ethernet, high-capacity SSD, 15” screen, long battery life, non-touch screen, no-hesitation processing speed, a Core i5 7th Gen processor, and full keyboard with numpad. This unit met all those criteria, and the 12 months no interest plan made it very affordable. The only sour feelings I had about this purchase were based on the lack of BestBuyRewards points I failed to earn. The associate failed to mention that by financing the unit, I was ineligible for rewards points. And while this stipulation was likely written in fine print somewhere, I failed to read it so that’s on me.
Back to the laptop, it is, in summary, a lightweight powerhouse. For low resources task, it practically anticipates your requests because the applications open so fast. Compared to my work HP ZBOOK which leaves deep crease lines in your lap after a half hour of use, this 250 model weighs nearly nothing, and seems to perform (for my needs) identically.","HP - 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - Dark Ash Silver, Woven Texture",0,WVElectEngr

Great features. Good balance of price & performanc,5,0,"This laptop fit my changing needs. I no longer need to have the latest and fastest as I no longer do video editing or Photoshop beyond Elements. So for small business home office work like spreadsheets, internet use and leisure time electronic puzzles and games the large screen was very useful. Also nice is still having a DVD burner, SD car slot, USB 3.0 in two forms and a 2.0, headphone/mic jack. The screen feature: ""night light"" which changes color temperature to help with insomnia was a nice bonus.
I'm also using this machine as a transition to Windows 10 after avoiding it like the plague for two years (I tried it when free and changed back to my trusty W7Pro). It was just too ""frilly"" and non-business-like. For this machine I found a free program called ""Classic Shell"" that works way too well to have been free - not complaining, mind you. It turns the start menu back into one you exactly recognize from Windows 7, including sub-menus, so you can actually find stuff again and make settings easily. And it has a button at the top of the classic W7 menu that with one press instantly reverts to the W10 start menu like you never changed anything. then back again with another click. Best of both worlds at the press of a button.
The 5400 RPM HD I knew would be too slow for me with an i5 gen 8 processor, so I ordered a $109 Samsung 860 EVO 500 Gig SSD on Best Buy at the same time and cloned the OEM HD with a bootable disk of Acronis (I already had for backups and cloning). The boot time went to 20 seconds and resume time to 4 to the log-in screen. If you're going to do that swap, do it first thing: Put the new SSD into the laptop first before ever starting it up (a very easy swap-out inside the access door on the bottom), stick the DVD with Acronis or similar in the optical drive and start the computer. Wait (pretty long) for the prom to boot and figure out there is no operating system (no need to check boot order with UEFI. It figures it out.) and goes looking in the optical drive. After Acronis boots (took about 2 whole minutes for me) and appears on the screen plug in your original drive via USB and a SATA to USB adapter (cheap- also on Best Buy. Don't plug it in before booting like Acronis tells you to do or it won't work. I found out the hard way). Order the SATA/USB cable adapter at the same time too if you don't have one. I already use one for my network storage on a 1T SSD (plugged into my AC cable modem/router so I have all my files from several computers in one place). Acronis will take care of partition resizing to go from the 1 T spinning drive to the 500G SSD (if you, like I, didn't need 1T of storage or needless expense). Last, after doing all the Windows updates on the new SSD you can load your old files from the back-up of your old laptop you made with Windows Back-UP. W10 has that nice feature in ""Back-Up and Restore (W7)"" and will find the back-up on disk, DVD, network storage, cloud storage, etc. if you tell it where to look. My back-ups are on an external SSD so it went very fast via the USB 3.0 plug using that same SATA/USB cable adapter.
The end result is a very fast, big screen, feature rich laptop with sufficient memory at 8G (expandable to 16) at a real bargain price! I'm probably going to get another one for my wife.","Acer - Aspire 5 17.3"" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Obsidian Black",0,David
