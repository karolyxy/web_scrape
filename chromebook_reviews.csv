"1","HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Privacy Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - HP finish in natural silver","So Far . . . So Good!","Cobra","5","I've had multiple HP computers (Laptops & Desktops) over the last few decades and this is among the best I've had. The 8th generation i7 performance is screaming! I can run multiple large programs at the same time without even a hint of lag or issues. I almost bought one of the 7th generation (which are fine actually), but I'm very happy I held off for the 8th gen version. Everything works flawlessly but if I have one criticism it would be the trackpad, which is kind of ""wonky"" although it works. I use a small mouse and therefore don't use the trackpad at all. An extra USB plug would have been nice but I can live with the two 3.1 C type plugs and the one traditional USB 3.1 plug. Loading speed from my external Samsung T3 500gb hard drive is blazingly fast.

The computer is lightweight and very thin. The included leather carrying sleeve was a nice touch as well. The screen is bright and the lighted keyboard is very nice. I'm glad I didn't selected the 4K screen because the battery would take a larger hit. Frankly, the 4K screen models aren't as significantly better as you might think. The battery on this HD screen lasts for hours and hours even with my brightness turned up so very efficient power management is at work here. I was most impressed with the fact that no matter how much I stressed the machine with programs it NEVER got hot! You could keep this on your lap wearing shorts with no discomfort at all. The cooling efficiency is superb and it was very quiet. The all SSD 512gb drive is super fast and I'll never go back to a traditional mechanical drive again. Having 16gb available allows me to run intensive graphic programs with ease. The keyboard is comfortable, fast and no lagging issues were detected. I would buy this again and highly recommend it to others. I opted for the 3 yr. Geek Squad coverage and the peace of mind is most welcome.","15","2"
"2","HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Privacy Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - HP finish in natural silver","Excellent!!!","chadw31","5","The HP Spectre is perfect for anyone who is searching for a fast, user-friendly, and portable laptop. Being a student in college for more than seven years, I can provide a strong endorsement for this laptop to fellow students. Having owned this laptop for over a month now, I've gained a good understanding of the key aspects that the Spectre brings to the user. 

Lightning-fast: 
Supporting the state-of-the-art, 8th Generation Intel Core i7 1.8-gigahertz mobile processor, the Spectre will provide all the speed you need. You won’t just be getting your work done in a fast-paced manner, with this processor, you’ll be able to meet all your entertainment needs without any lagging or frustrating interruptions. Also, the laptop’s hard drive is a solid-state drive (SSD). Given the high-speed performance of the SSD, this will allow you to start or restart your laptop in seconds, outperforming slower startups and reboots from hard disk drives.

User-friendly:
Everyone both loves—and needs—an easy-to-use laptop in today’s clustered, complicated world; the Spectre far exceeded my expectations in this category. Utilizing Windows 10, you will find yourself effortlessly using apps, organizing your files, and customizing user settings to create—as well as enhance—your experience. This experience is continued in the Spectre’s versatile tablet mode where you can take notes or browse using the handy stylus. Some other notable, convenient features include: a privacy screen, fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, and long-lasting battery. The Spectre’s durable battery will provide you hours of use without having to worry about recharging. 
Since there’s no such thing as a perfect laptop, there are a couple minor drawbacks. The Spectre only has one USB port and no DVD/CD drive. These excluded hardware features were disappointing to me at first; however, technological progress is accelerating to the point where ports and DVD/CD will be used far less often, if at all.

Portability:
As someone who has nearly lifelong experience with computers and laptops, as well as extensive familiarity in collegiate environments, the Spectre is a perfect fit for college students. This is the second laptop I’ve owned since starting college. My first laptop was significantly bigger and heavier than the Spectre, making it a much-needed weight off my shoulders and back. The laptop weighs in at a mere 2.78 pounds, which makes for trekking around campus much easier when carrying a laptop in your backpack.","2","0"
"3","HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Privacy Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - HP finish in natural silver","Sleek, sufficently powerful and functional","JohnnyBB","5","I bought one of these during the black Friday sale and although I could not snag the best buy deal, I did order it on the HP site (they were a bit more expensive but still had a great price during that time). The benefit though was for an extra $10 I got the dark ash color, otherwise, it is the same spec as this one (16GB RAM, 512 SSD, 1080p). 

I have been using this laptop for the last three months and I absolutely love it. I am not going to nit-pick the track-pad, honestly do not see any issue with it. The 1080p screen choice is the right one for this form factor - while I was at the store I found it wonky to buy the 4K screen only to have to zoom the screen by 300% for it to be usable on the laptop - so I say direct your 4K dreams on a massive TV. The battery life as expected, is great if all you are doing light stuff. I do a little tinkering on app development and when I have many (and I mean many) things going on at once this thing becomes hot as a griddle - but I understand why.

Windows is a smooth operating platform and I absolutely love the windows hello feature, I resisted at first but that feature makes owning this machine all the more enjoyable. The finger-print reader is nice too but it is so much more convenient to open the lid and get recognized instantly.

Tip for people who do not like bloatware: you can basically make your PC signature series like by going into windows defender performance and health settings and follow directions for a fresh restart install of windows without all the bloat. Best you do this right after you initially set it up, the antivirus the laptop comes with disables defender which is probably why the manufacturer likes to bundle it. You can still go into settings and activate defender and disable the preloaded anti-virus.","5","0"
"4","HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Privacy Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - HP finish in natural silver","Great Laptop!","PKTech","5","I've never owned a laptop with solid state drive, so this is a wonderful new experience. It is very fast, with no lag, and it's extremely lightweight and portable. The screen resolution is crisp, vibrant and beautiful for a full HD. Also, I love the features of this laptop. HP's Support Assistant makes it very user friendly. 

Happily. I've discovered it doesn't seem to run hot, only with the initial updating. The Support Assitant will let you know which updates to download (including BIOS) and that's so easy and convenient! 

By the way, here's a tip I've discovered: I used to prefer the Chrome browser, but that seemed to create some heat. I've since switched to the Microsoft Edge browser and this laptop runs cool as a cucumber.
All in all, I have to say, this laptop has been amazing so far. I've only had it for a few weeks, but I'm very satisfied and happy with my purchase.","2","0"
"5","HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Privacy Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - HP finish in natural silver","Pretty nice","Jaxyn","5","First off this thing is awesome. I’ve been trying to find a combination of processes to slow it down and I cant. I’m not a techy person. I just want a computer that always works. This does that. I’ve had it for about two months and have only charged it about four times. The battery life is amazing as well. I’ve been able to conduct work projects and listen to Audible as well as complete language training without the battery dying for hours. The screen rotation from closed to tablet function is flawless. I worried that there would be catching but it is awesome. 
The only issue and it’s minor is the fingerprint thing doesn’t always recognize my finger. But I put in my pin and all is well. 

Oh and the hidey screen is great because I have to screen patient records and it maintains the greatest privacy.","1","0"

The Yoga had poor build quality and the screen wasn't that bright. My first Spectre had a yellow tint to the screen and it always ran hot fan was on all the time at idle. Upgraded the BIOS and all other updates still ran very hot and was uncomfortable placed on your lap. Second one the screen was slightly better but still ran super hot even with nothing running. The speakers crackle as well. The screen is also very grainy from what I've noticed. There's nothing else I want in the market right now. Just needed an ultra portable laptop to do some work while traveling. Might return the 2nd Spectre as well.","2","0"

The privacy screen function is very helpful. My prior laptop was a Lenovo Yoga that was subject to the preinstalled spyware, which I despised. I was dismayed to find that HP had preinstalled spyware and a keylogger on this and other laptop models based on online reports, although I was able to remove them based on the information from those reports.","8","0"

Lightweight, comfortable keyboard, lightening fast speed, great screen resolution. One feature I do not like is that the fingerprint scanner is on the side. It makes it difficult to read - maybe I am a beginner and am not doing it right, but it should be on the top/flat surface of the machine. Otherwise, it is fantastic.","4","0"
"9","Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - Theoretical Gray","All the right specs, poor engineering and QC","Alex","3","The computer has all the specs that I desired, but simply can't compete with apple in terms of quality and usability. Dell copied apple with the introduction of a large touchpad, but failed to perform adequate quality control. The software simply can't handle incidental brushes of the touchpad while typing, which means that typing any significant length of text (including this review) necessitates fumbling to undo text inserted in unexpected places. Not to mention that pressure on the palm rests alone, with no touching of the touch pad, is enough to trigger a mouse click! If you don't have the software tools to deal with a large touchpad, simply stick with a small one that doesn't get in the way! Also, the algorithm used to determine if fingers are moving apart or together (for a pinch gesture) is far too sensitive. Using the two finger scrolling get's annoying, because it's constantly resizing my browser text. Lastly, they seem to have copied most of apple's short cut functions, accept they don't have a side to side scroll. (Annoying! But probably the fault of Microsoft and not Dell.) The three finger gestures can also use some work; they're too touchy. Furthermore, the sound rocker flips orientation when changing to tablet mode, but this isn't always what you want. In the movie-watching, ""tent"" configuration it's upside down. This should be controlled by a sensor that identifies which way is up, or they should allow the user to configure what they want. 
I like the back-lit keyboard for working in the dark, but the power led is way too bright when working in complete darkness. It's very distracting. 
On the whole, I'm going to try to adjust to the low quality product that I purchased. Hopefully they come up with a software update that fixes some of the issues with their touchpad! This is my first and probably my last Dell Laptop purchase.","7","5"
"10","Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - Theoretical Gray","Great - after two repairs","PeruGuy","1","The laptop is attractive and works well -- after two repairs. When It was only two weeks old, it developed a problem charging the battery. I took it back to Best Buy, shortly after the return period expired, and was told that I’d have to send it back to Dell for repairs. The computer was less than one month old! I sent it back in and received it a couple weeks later. They did not fix it and the same problem occurred again. So, I had to send it in again. This is one of two Inspirons that I've purchased in the last 18 months. The second, the 13” version of the same laptop, has a similar story. A couple of weeks into the new purchase, the screen went very dim and started to flicker. I called Dell and was told that I needed to send the computer in for a new screen. The computer was three weeks old!!! So, now, I’m reliving the same experience. In both cases, I could have bought Best Buy’s Geek Squad protection (i.e., additional money for an extended warranty on a brand-new product), but I firmly believe that I should not have to pay additional money to purchase a working product. I would be wary of buying the Inspiron 7000 series. If you do, save all the original packaging to make it easier when you send it off for repairs.","1","0"
"11","Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - Theoretical Gray","Luv touchscreen w/laptop feature","ChrisQ","4","Replaced Asus desktop all in one that died for no reason after 2 yrs. I have had this Dell for 1 month. I will not buy another desktop.

Two features I think I cannot live w/o anymore in my laptop - well lit keyboard & touchscreen.

Pros: 
Monitor - great view, I can use this as a touch screen or a traditional laptop
Keyboard- keys are well lit, not too close together (but does take getting used to if you are switching from traditional keyboard- keys seem closer together), I like that I can feel the keys being pressed
Speed: I stream and have many windows open at same time and no issues so far.
Software: No problems so far
Uses: I use it for streaming, email, spreadsheets, word processing and internet searching (I do not do any gaming on this computer)
Size: Large enough to have multiple windows open but still small enough for lap use
Heat: Quiet- I don't really hear the fan, Don't really feel too much heat after hours of lap use (previous laptop got very hot and was really loud)
Desk use: There is a non-stick strip on the bottom so the laptop does not shift on a smooth surface

Cons: 
Don't like the position of the on/off switch, no CD ability, only one HDMI port, uses about 10% of the battery ever hour - and takes a while to charge.","2","1"
"12","Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - Theoretical Gray","fast and overall a good value","ebk02","4","Overall, this seems to be a good choice for price/performance/ hardware specs. Has glass screen - will resist scratches better than membrane type. Two levels of keyboard backlight. Keyboard has spacious layout, and reasonable key feel/travel. With SSD, 16 GB ram, and I7 core, the computer is fast, and so far I haven't even taxed it - fans hardly ever run. There are a few cons/areas for improvement however. The keyboard backlight is uneven, and the ""M"" is much brighter than other keys. The power button is a bit recessed, and requires a strong ""press"". The bezel around screen could have been trimmed down for a more compact look. And, as far as I can tell, the entire housing is plastic, and could have been made with alloys or composites to add a slimmer, and lighter look/feel.","8","0"

The computer is thin and lightwait and the set up was easy. I have had it only a short time but so far it does all I could ask for. I’m not a gamer so I don’t use it for that. It boots quickly and has great screen resolution. The battery life is within the time frame given in specs. Love the touch screen. Still learning Windows 10.","4","0"

"16","Lenovo - 2-in-1 11.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Black","Good for Note-taking.","Ahsan","4","I will start my review by saying this, I am an extremely tech-savvy person and know a thing or two about computers. Currently I run a fully custom built PC as my workstation at home, and use an older MacBook Pro for note taking. My wife has an Acer R-15 Aspire 2-in-1 laptop, and wanted a note-taking computer for her classes. I suggested a Chromebook to her as she did not want to spend more than $300, but with her specifications that left little to choice. She wanted to see an Acer R-11 as it very much resembled a mini version of her current home use laptop. However, she quickly changed her mind when she viewed it in person, and instead this Lenovo caught her eye. I'll admit this notebook (NOT a laptop) is relatively slower than all of our other conputers, but for $300 nowadays you really can't complain. Heck, my smartphone is $900 unlocked...and that's a phone. Anyways, Intel Celeron is nothing special and is perfectly adequate for running 1 or 2 low to medium profile programs at any time. It has a low core count, meaning multitasking is NOT it's speciality. It is not exceptionally fast as a result, but it's not working in sludge either. It's quick enough for common usage. The memory or RAM is 2GB of DDR3. DDR3 is older tech with DDR4 now being available, but for note-taking and mild social media usage you won't need much more. There's no running games on this thing either unless you want to fry the integrated Intel Graphics card. 720p is also expected at this price. What this notebook is good for is ... taking notes quickly, and looking up things when working on the go. If you want more than that, look elsewhere. Overall, good little backpack buddy to have in class or when traveling!","36","1"
"17","Lenovo - 2-in-1 11.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Black","Good IdeaPad LeNovo Attempt at 2 in 1","scottmcon","3","Would recommend this with the caution that the notebook has more power demands on it than the Celeron can manage quickly. Used a non-touch simple laptop notebook, a LeNovo Idea Pad with an Intel Atom and the emmc. Fast as expected & very light in processing. Because I thought that the smaller Red top Ideapad Lenovo notebook worked quickly and well, I assumed the newer 2 in 1 with the Celeron would also. I was wrong. The 64gb expanded flash memory is good; the touch and flip hinge (360)were desired, but the speed was actually slower in use. The AC WiFi Dual-band was also a plus reason to buy. The color like a light grey metal with a black lid appealed. So did the additional ports, and the internal Dolby Sound free enhancement feature option appeal. The first sign on though is set to impede MSN registration without an open WiFi network - this includes getting a first hand use at a necessary security MAC number. So try it with a less secure more open WiFi network. The follow up MSN re-registration by MSN email account is barred by a shadow double user effect seen registering the same simple Window account. Lastly, the Comcast Xfinity TV streaming would balk and not register the 2 in 1 as a device at that portal when using Windows 10 Edge browser. If still buying, it did properly register an XFINITY user device - tv.xfinity.com - when the Google Chrome browser was downloaded and tried with that streaming service. Still recommended but with those qualifications. A heavier device and strong good keyboard. Fast tablet to notebook & return as Windows 10 provides. Also prefer a 64b architecture.","5","0"

It is generally attractive and converts into a tablet. My planned uses were basic: homework and social media. I was informed by the sales staff that it would be slow, but I didn't think that it would be this slow. I should have figured when the actual display model froze during a demonstration. I returned this device today after a frustrating fifteen days of trying to do my homework. At first, I chose this tablet for how my small hands fit on the keyboard and the touchscreen capability. After two weeks the keyboard was still uncomfortably awkward for me to type with (particularly because of the shortened keys) and the touchscreen along with the touchpad had incredibly poor responses. Then, the device was temperamental with streaming videos. Sometimes I would get visual but most times it was just audio. All of that in addition to the slow processing and frequent freezing was enough for me to make the decision to return this device.","68","12"

I wish I had seen reviews before buying. I thought this would be a good replacement for my old HP Netbook. I hated the notebook because it only had a 32GB HD. And with 64GB I was able to install the full Office App and have about 15 GB free. So this I thought was the answer. Until I noticed, you can't do more than two things at a time. I really only needed to check e-mail and maybe edit a word document here and there. But also enjoy playing Youtube in the background as I work. DONT EVEN TRY IT. I have made every adjustment you can think of to free up resources, this thing will still choke. My mistake was being convinced that I could find a way to make it work. Only to learn...it is what it is. I opted out for a cheap system. I got my money's worth. Only gave it two stars because it did hold more data than my old 32GB. Other than that...I wish my old 32GB had never died. At lest it responded like a computer. This is more like 10 year old Android device. Taking advantage of the Windows 10 Min requirements. Never trust the Min Requirements.","1","0"

Since my company runs all of our apps through Citrix XenDesktop, the entry level processor and 2GB of RAM are no big deal. Even off the corporate network, this unit is fine for email, web browsing, Office apps and streaming video off the internet. I like the fact that it has an ethernet jack in addition to WiFi and Bluetooth. The 64GB eMMC drive is plenty for me because all my files are in the cloud. While not as fast as a SSD, the eMMC drive performs better than a basic mechanical drive. The HDMI port is a plus, as I can stream video and play it on a big screen TV - no problem! It has a MMC card slot so if you need more storage, you can buy another 64GB card for around $25 and set Windows to move your apps to your additional storage. Keep in mind, with its limited RAM, processor and storage, any sort of PC gaming is strictly off limits. Stay within the limits and you'll be happy like I am.","3","0"

Battery life is about average as well. 
I see that there are a few issues with shutting down. I suspect that this could partially be due to the fact that it uses a keyboard key for a power button. It's very easy to brush it and the screen goes off instantly, though the machine is still on. I'm sure that there could be hardware issues causing this issue as well. I would think that a weak power key return spring could cause much havoc. Since It appears that many of the cheap computers are using this design as well, it is probably going to be a problem across many brands. 
I've also read about it being sluggish and unstable. I believe this is mostly due to windows updates running in the background. I have 8 computers of various brands and all of them have been struggling with the latest bunch of windows updates. These updates are not supposed to interrupt your usage but I have found that they have been causing all of my machines to be sluggish and unstable. If you leave the machine on for long periods of time while its not being used and restart it often, it should finish updates and it runs very well. Mine opens programs and webpages just about as fast as I can click on them. It plays video flawlessly and touch pad works very well. This machine surfs the web and runs all my programs as fast as my desktop with a 3.7ghz i3 and 8gb or ram. The only negative thing I can find with this machine is that the fan emits a low hum/buzz noise that can be annoying in a very quiet room. It's really not noticable while using the machine on a solid surface, but if you pick it up and hold it at various angles the volume increases and the character of the noise changes. Most people don't hold a computer of this size anyway, so it probably won't be an issue.","172","27"

You're buying a $230.00 laptop don't think it's going to be lightning fast out of the box. It comes with Windows 10 and sadly it's a resource hungry operating system. The computer will be slow and have a rough time with more than one or two apps open at the same time. visually it looks great but it's hard to get past the speed issues. I really like windows but this laptop won't run it efficiently. if you have any computer skills what so ever you can side load a windows like version of Linux like Zorin Os or Chalet Os either is great for this machine and it will run lightning fast without issues and of course if you still need windows you can split the harddrive in half and use half for Linux and the other half for windows so you'll get the best of both worlds. I haven't had the issues that other people have had with the system just shutting off or not holding a charge. So far the hardware seems solid on this machine. For the people that are upset because this pc can't play dvds without buying special software, seriously people, we live in the age of the Internet. Go to any search engine and look up open source media player and get one for free. Don't give the pc a bad review just because you didn't do your research. Overall this is a great little PC and it was extremely cheap so i can't complain. I hope this helps out.","67","9"

I just wanted a simple computer for very basic web browsing and word processing.

Here was my experience and my advice to you: 

 1) It was slow. I went through and disabled all the bloatware that came installed on the product, but the computer was still running out of resources just running the operating system. It was literally running 100% CPU and 100% Disk Usage.

2) It makes a terrible noise. It sounded like a it had a little engine inside it. That just made me nervous about the longevity of the product.

3) Cheap construction. It's hard to describe, but you'll know what I mean if you decided to purchase it. It just feels like it had low quality components .

4) Every finger print shows. To be fair, I would have kept the computer if this was the main problem. It was really just the straw that broke the camels back. After the first day, I had finger prints showing all over the lid. It just made it look dirty. 

I read some of these points from other reviews but decided to purchase it anyway. I'm not sorry I purchased it, because now I feel better about spending a little more on something that will last me longer. 
My advice to you if you really want to buy it is to buy from a store that you know will accept a return, and save all the packaging and your receipt for a while. That way you can evaluate it for yourself and make your own decision without the risk of being stuck with a bad product. I hope this review helps.","20","3"

Worst computer purchase since 1992 and DOS 3.0. Bought this ASUS X541NA-PD10003Y for my Mother a week ago, she is not a power user like I am. Within 24 hours the Wi-Fi disconnected twice (Win10 Wi-Fi set to Wi-Fi Performance, Sleep/Hibernate disabled). I uninstalled the network controller, rebooted, let Win10 reinstall it, downloaded and installed Network Drivers from ASUS website, Wi-Fi still randomly disconnects (never seen this on any priced system). Chatted with ASUS online, no resolution, they said likely a bad computer (hardware rarely fails, except hard drives, I suspect their drivers are poorly coded). Today, 17DEC2017, we noticed that when running on battery only and moving the screen slightly, the computer shutdown completely despite a full battery charge (imagine working on a long document which had not been saved!..total loss of data!!!, unacceptable!). Seems that when on battery power, the device loses connection to the battery. Returning this garbage computer today, to Best Buy to exchange for an HP with an Intel Gen7/I5 processor, double the HD at 1TB and double the RAM at 8GB for only $150 more. Wasted 2 days installing MS Office, Adobe CC, and other software I install on all systems. I am using Acronis software to backup the entire drive including the Master Book Record (including Win10 and all software data installed, will reduce my setup of the replacement system from 2 days to about 2 hours.","21","7"

Because they say they haven’t received the charger yet, so after checking with the post office, and confirming it was delivered to the address ASUS supplied me, ANOTHER 15 days pass, they still say they haven’t received charger, so NOW they’re demanding proof of delivery from the post office, which they don’t do with regular mail, so I get a case number and the tracking information and forward it to asus. 9 days later? They send an email saying it was delivered to the WRONG ADDRESS, mind you? It’s the address THEY TOLD ME TO SEND THE CHARGER TO!!! and they say it’s the wrong address because they only receive mail at ONE DOOR behind the building, next to the receiving dock, not the front of the building, that’s marked with the address they sent me....I would avoid buying any asus product unless your content getting the run around from “customer support”.","4","1"

The price difference from a closed box to an open box was 20-30 (can’t recall the exact amount) I pay for an open box because it was certificated to be in functional conditions. What did I get? An open box with a laptop missing the charger and to make it worse, the laptop is not functional!! I spent additional money to buy a charger and try to solve the problem. The thing is that the laptop did not even work. It keeps shutting down even connected to the charger. It keeps throwing driver errors. I tried to fix this problem aswell with additional money, of course, so I went with a technician and it has no reparation!!

For the cost, without the sale it is still cheaper than what Dell sells on website. With the sale it is honestly an amazing value. 

It is extremely fast with the quad core AMD Ryzen 7 and 12GB dual channel ddr4 RAM and 256GB ssd. These specs are very good and at the current price you won't find a better deal anywhere than BestBuy! 

Not only are the specs on paper nice but the laptop feels sturdy and well built. The screen is bright and very nice with a glass touchscreen. The sound is good with the only concern being bottom firing. The backlit keys have two light settings and turn off when not in use. 

The laptop has plenty of ports and has an all aluminum build. I just got the PC so I haven't had a chance to test battery life completely but so far it seems to go about 5-6 hours heavy use and with the settings and brightness tweaked it should go to 8 hours. 

The keyboard is responsive and feels good. 

Overall my initial impressions are very good. This is an awesome device. Also because it has the AMD Ryzen 7 it is close to the latest gen core i7 from Intel but the integrated Vega 10 graphics are about double to triple the performance of Intel and close to the Nvidia mx150 dedicated graphics card. You can play games with decent settings on this laptop. 

I highly recommend it to anyone. I don't understand the negative reviews. Try this for yourself and if you are on the fence just go for it!!","12","2"

I knew I had to get it ""right"". I wasn't really interested in a 2-in-1, but let me tell you, the touchscreen is a huge bonus (especially considering it's what we use on our phones everyday). One thing that's always bothered me about most mobile computers has been the external body design/shape. This one (and most of the Inspiron offerings) is very sleek. When closed it has a similar profile to an iPhone and it looks very nice. Let's move on from vanity to operation.

This particular model has the best CPU that you can buy for practical home uses. That, coupled with 12 GB of RAM, allows you to run multiple high-profile applications seamlessly. The SSD allows me to log into Windows within 8 seconds of turning the PC on. That's unheard of to me. The integrated graphics card is good enough to run pretty much any casual game comfortably, and that's all I honestly need, considering that I'm a PS4 gamer. I didn't know that this comp has a back-lit keyboard and that was really, really cool to have discovered out of the box.

I run my power settings at next-to-maximum performance, and 50% brightness, which yields about 6 hours of battery life. I honestly don't think that there's a negative thing to say about this model. Back in 2010, Dell was a below-average brand, and Sony ran the show from performance and durability standards. It's now looking like Dell is where Sony used to be (and Sony just abandoned the mobile PC platform altogether). I looked a some other brands, and other Dell models, and this feels to be a long-term PC solution. A great computer that I plan on using for as long as it works.","3","0"

The price was different in store compared to their app so I get the adjustment. Hours later the price is now +100 so yay me. Also, to have a AMD Ryzen 7 2400u with a 12GB and a 256 SSD for this price is just insane. Not an M2 SSD drive but I'm not working on it, this is for fun. After all updates including the BIOS firmware update and all scans, this laptop sits quietly and I do not hear the fan so I don't know what those comments are about. I do head the fan when the processor is working hard but it's not annoying. The nic is fast. The touch screen is great and if you poke it, it does not wobble like some of the other 2 in 1's I tested. The Asus was the best at this test, didn't even move a centimeter. This one moved ever so slightly but doesn't rubber band. Can't complain because I cannot believe I scored such a solid and packed laptop. I hope my nic doesn't die like I read the other reviewer said. I'm done with Lenovo because of that. Had the entire board die just after the 2 year warranty. This is my first Dell. Wish me luck!

Only complaint is the power adapter. I can totally see this thing not lasting long however it's fine now and the plug in to the laptop, if one isn't careful I can see it easily snapping off if clipped accidentally. I don't know why manufacturers don't improve such a major component of a laptop. The Surface Pro has a pretty cool power plug. I think that would be a great addition.","3","0"

After a week of research for a replacement and using my tablet, I went looking for a replacement at all the main on line computer stores, HP, Dell, Asus, etc... 
I have always been open to AMD processors and have owned a few in the past. The new AMD Ryzen CPUs with integrated graphics have shown promising benchmarks at a much lower cost than Intels offering, so off to Best Buy I went. 
Best Buy had a Ryzen 5 with 8 MB, SSD and VEGA GPU on display, this was a little less than I wanted. I was looking for 16 MB ram with a Ryzen 5 processor. After talking with the sales rep, he said the Ryzen 7 laptop was on sale, and they had one in stock. Wow, 12 MB of RAM, Ryzen 7, 256 GB SSD, what more could I ask for, except it only had a 13 inch display. Needless to say, the laptop had almost everything I was looking for except the display was smaller than I wanted, but the price was just right.
Well, 2 weeks after purchasing this laptop, I have zero regrets. The time from a cold start to windows 10 desktop is less than 15 seconds. The power of this laptop not only replaces my old laptop, but could replace most desktop computers as well. This thing is a steal at this price. Would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a casual gaming laptop, video editing, internet browsing, etc... No regrets. I would give it 6 stars if I could.","8","4"

I usually use my desktop for most of my PC work (and my phone for everything else), but I’ve been spending more and more time on domestic flights, and I needed a laptop that I could fit on a tray table in economy seating. So, I gave this Dell a shot.

I was really surprised that not only was I able to use the laptop for the basic email ,online and productivity apps, but I could also play a number of my favorite games like Civilization 6 without missing a beat. 

I thought I needed a desktop graphics card to have this level of gaming performance, but it turns out this AMD CPU has Radeon Vega Graphics built -n and it played the game just as smoothly as my home desktop PC with a dedicated graphics card.

The convertible screen also lets me turn this laptop into a tent or a tablet that is convenient when watching on-plane movies on Southwest or Netflix at home. The battery life held up great and I was able to watch multiple saved shows on my Amazon app without worrying about recharging in-flight.

I would absolutely recommend this laptop. It is elegant, the perfect size for travel, and the added graphics performance and processor horsepower really make it a homerun.","7","2"

A complainer mentioned the noise of the fan. The fan noise is audible when doing any gaming. And that's why I would give this product a 4.5 star review if I could. While web browsing or watching YouTube videos... if the fan is on I cant hear it.

I didn't have any luck finding a case that I think would adequately protect this product while maintaining mobility and ventilation of internal fans.

Battery life is better than average and the screen is beautiful. My wife uses it for daily work in the IT world and we take it on vacation with us when we go. Bought an optional LG USB blu-ray player and it plays any disk smoothly with no fan noise from the CPU. The AMD Ryzen 4 core 8 thread CPU along with the AMD Vega 10 graphics seen to handle any load without a hiccup and the HDMI output allows us to drive large displays and TV's when we need a larger screen.

Other than that, and I can highly recommend this AMD laptop. Glad to see such a great AMD system in such a small package.

For those who consider gaming on it, it runs older games with ease. For newer games, I was getting maybe ~30 FPS in Fallout 4 at 720p low settings, and 18-20FPS in Far Cry 5 at 720p. Not a power gamer, but good for old stuff.","1","0"

Honestly, it has a great build to it, nice style, great keyboard and silky smooth track pad and big hard drive. The problem unfortunately, is that it uses a conventional hard drive coupled with a measly 4 megs of RAM. Running Windows 10 and any of the big applications (think Microsoft Office) brought this laptop to its knees, waiting for apps to open. My toes would literally curl. I'm using this primarily for business - a portable to use when I'm not at my office desktop. But the sheer unresponsiveness or lag with virtually every application I threw at it led to me to look for an alternative. And I searched high and low. I looked at the Spectras from HP and looked at the ASUS books --- you can find things wrong with almost all of them - folks complaining about the heat they give off, etc. I also didn't want to drop $1500 bucks on a laptop. So I thought about the things I loved about this Lenovo laptop and decided to trade up to the Lenovo Yoga 720. I will tell you so far I've spent the day reloading all my apps and I absolutely love the Yoga 720. It's got a solid state drive (just 250 gigs) but it's got 8 megs of RAM and let me tell you -that makes all the difference in the world. Every app I throw at it literally pops! Opens quick. The unit does not seem to heat up. No noisy fan. It's got the same great keyboard and even backlit. Battery seems adequate. Do yourself a favor - spring for the extra few bucks to get the 720 because its the difference between having a computer that can keep up with you or having one that is constantly lagging behind you.","124","35"

I was looking for something in stock around the $300-$500 price point that was smaller and sleeker than my Toshiba. I am primarily a web and word processing user but am also getting into coding and web development. I wanted to get my hands on a demo before I purchased a laptop so I went to the store. The look and feel of this laptop gave me the impression that it is of good quality. The top lid has a rubbery feel that is not sticky and seems to be scratch resistant so far. It took some time to get used to a smaller keyboard without a standalone number pad but I've found this keyboard to function well and be comfortable. My backspace key is a little squeaky but it may get quieter as it get's worn in. The awkwardness of getting used to a smaller keyboard is worth it for the overall portability and comfort of having a smaller laptop in various situations. I don't use the touch screen much but it is pretty responsive and convenient. I'm impressed with the battery life on this guy. I haven't really tracked how long it is lasting me under heavy use but I'm not worried about always having the charger and an outlet at the ready. This laptop is quiet and generates very little heat when in my lap. Every other little thing I love about this laptop is mainly due to having the features and benefits of a modern laptop! i.e. webcam, bluetooth connections, and larger hard drives. My one negative about this laptop would be that the RAM cannot be upgraded. It's not really a negative for me now, but it may be in the future.","12","11"

As soon as the program loaded, I magically had sound. 

Today I had to call in because five keys were not working. The background noise at the service center made it nearly impossible to understand the support personnel. The person was helpful and the problem resolved, but the call was excruciating. 

I bought Lenovo after researching the best inexpensive laptops. I use one for research and writing, so I don't need media bells and whistles (but it is nice to hear them when needed). Reviews said the IdeaPad would be slow, which I can deal with, and I wasn't expecting fancy. But two calls in six weeks has shaken my confidence in the purchase. I wish I had bought another Toshiba (not sure why I didn't).","2","1"

It is competitively priced and has great features. It has one 3.1C HDMI port and two 3.0 HDMI ports. The keypad is second to none and this laptop has a speedy Pentium Gold processor. I used this laptop for about an hour before I installed a 8gb RAM chip and an Samsung 500gb SSD drive. Once I installed those upgrades this little laptop is as fast or faster than my I-5 laptop with an SSD drive as well. I exchanged the Lenovo Flex 4 that is sold by Best Buy for this because I like the feel of the keyboard, color and small features better on this IDEAPAD better. If you don't mind upgrading the RAM 8gb and Installing a SSD drive, then this computer is a steal for all of the features that it comes with.","61","31"

While it is not a powerhouse laptop, it was the perfect gift for my wife. Her use mainly consists of keeping up on Facebook, email, messaging, surfing the net and simple online gaming during the day. In the evening she uses it to stream television shows from Netflix and Hulu. She loves the fact that the keyboard can fold back into presentation mode for this and that the touchscreen allows for easy navigation. The sound quality from the built in speakers is what you would expect from a laptop so is usable, but she generally uses headphones when streaming. For me, the screen resolution is a little low but for her it works just fine. In fact, a higher resolution display would be money wasted for her as she likes the larger text for readability. All in all, if there is a better laptop for the money at this price point.","2","0"

I originally planned to edit videos and use this for schoolwork and work. If you're planning to game on this stay away from it. For $2k you can build a way better gaming PC as this comes with no Graphic Card aside from onboard gpu that's pretty weak for gaming. I dislike that there is only 1 port for 3.0 USB.

"64","Lenovo - Yoga 720 12.5"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i3 - 4GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Platinum","After Win 10 & BIOS update it's quick and stable","DocJekl","5","The TL;DR version is that is's speedy and stable for day to day tasks, with well over 6 hours of battery life when used hard. The pro's outweigh the cons, and I believe that I will be keeping this past the 30 day return window.

While my primary computer is a late 2014 15"" Macbook Pro, I was looking for a small portable budget 2-in-1, mostly to run Quicken 2017 financial software. Quicken running in a PC emulator on my Mac became too slow as my data file grew over the past 15 years. And running my copy of Win 7 Ultimate in Bootcamp for Mac to speed things up wasn't an option, because I needed occasional access to my Mac while using Quicken or other PC apps.

I first looked at several sub $400 2-in-1 laptops, including a $190 Lenovo with Celeron and 2GB/64GB, and a $330 HP with Pentium and 4GB/500GB 5400 rpm drive. Demoing these proved them to be too slow with even simple tasks or booting up, as was any other unit without an SSD or at least 4GB of RAM.

PROS: The Lenovo Yoga 720 blew those others away in comparison. And, the Yoga's sale price ($499) was almost the same price as the cheaper HP AFTER parts and labor to upgrade the HP to an SSD, which would have still had a much slower processor than the Yoga's i3-7100. This Yoga was about the same speed in my tests as a $700-800 Samsung and Yoga 13"", but saved me over $200-300. 

It's fast enough to be my primary computer, if not for the small 128GB storage space. The lack of SD card slot prevents one from using the internal storage for apps on drive C: while keeping data on a Drive E: SD card, unless you don't mind having a thumb drive, card reader, or HD hanging off the PC all the time.

When I first turned it on at home it was easy to set up, and Win 10 dovetailed right into my Hotmail.com account and linked my existing OneDrive to my documents folder. I was also given a Lenovo account in the process, that doesn't seem to do much of anything when you log in online. It also had me set up my fingerprint security during this process and choose a PIN (I used 8 digits). I REALLY like the fingerprint sensor which makes logging in very fast and simple, and it was quick to add another finger later. Few others if any in this price range had this feature.

I also decided to try the discounted $24 1yr McAfee antivirus for Lenovo, and can switch to Microsoft Windows Defender if the renewal is too much money in a year. I didn't even know about Windows Defender when I was setting it up, so I feel like Lenovo has a stake in getting us to buy McAfee, even at their discounted price. 

I also had to sign into my Office 365 account after the setup was done - the Office software came preinstalled, along with about 5 unnecessary games (Candy Crush Saga, Minecraft, etc). It also had PLEX preinstalled, and it works fine with the PLEX server on my NAS. The usual compliment of Microsoft apps were preinstalled as well.

After it was all set up, I used the Lenovo Vantage app that came pre-installed to update Windows 10 to the latest April 2018 version, which gave many recent reviewers problems with the trackpad. So I also ran the BIOS update that I downloaded from Lenovo, based on the tip by Lenovo support in previous reviews. This prevented any touch pad problems that other reviewers saw upon awakening the PC after they allowed it to sleep. The BIOS update I installed was dated May 25th 2018, but the previous BIOS also had this fix.

Finally, I installed Quicken 2017 which was the main reason I picked this up. It runs my large Quicken data file noticeably faster than a PC emulator on my Mac, even with my data going back over 15 years. I was able to get more transactions imported, categorized, and saved in a shorter amount of time, which is important since I have a several month backlog of data entry on which to get caught up.

I was worried that the small screen would be an issue with data entry, but the 1920x1080 12.5"" screen is crisp and clear, and I had no trouble reading the fine print with my 56 year old eyes.

While unplugged from power and green brightness at a moderate level, I used the Yoga 720 for over 6 hour straight while editing Quicken data, surfing the web, and installing apps, and the battery dropped to 15% during that time. It charged back to full in 1-2 hours (when I 1st plugged it in it estimated 1 hour to full charge). I'm sure I could stretch the battery out for another hour before it would shut down, without changing any settings.

I vaguely recall that the Yoga had over 80GB of the 117GB available free before I installed or removed anything. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the actual ""before"" storage. 

I removed some of the games that were preinstalled which saved 500-800MB, and then installed Adobe Reader, Dropbox, OneDrive, Spotify, Youtube, Facebook, Messenger, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon & Amazon Music, SiriusXM, and Kindle apps. With everything installed, including about 2GB of data in my OneDrive, I had 64GB free out of the 117GB available.

Free space dropped to 56GB when I installed iCloud for Windows and set up Outlook with my iCloud and Hotmail accounts. It imported all my data and 2GB iCloud drive, but not iPhotos which would need another 180GB! I also didn't sync my 40GB dropbox, and I'll have to use selective sync when I do. I like that with OneDrive I can choose to have some of the files reside only on the cloud, to save SSD space when I don't need them.

I found another setting to let me delete older versions of Windows which I allowed, since it has been rock stable and I don't need to roll back - that freed up 2GB, leaving me in the end with over 58GB free space and just over 58GB used, without turning on disk compression. 

Disk space can be saved by streaming most media instead of downloading it, but I'm barely using 50% of the hard drive right now. So, spending $200 more on the 13"" Yoga 720 with 8/256GB wasn't necessary unless this was my primary PC. If one needs more space, just don't install many of the above apps to free up 1-2GB, and use the web browser interface to access those services instead.

As for form factor, it's nice and thin and light, at a little over 1/2"" thick and 3lbs. The footprint is only slightly larger than a sheet of paper. It feels solid when carrying it around one handed, whether open or closed, or in tablet mode. It was easy, however, to accidentally press the power button on the middle of the right side and put it to sleep when picking it up. I would have preferred the power button to be farther back, maybe near the charging port on the left side near the rear. Fortunately, it's quick to wake up and log in with the fingerprint sensor.

CONS: (1) I do wish it had more ports than one USB-C and one USB-A, plus headphone jack. But $75 will buy a USB-C dongle with a USB-C pass-thru port, 2 USB 3.0, an Ethernet, and an HDMI port. One with an SD card reader and even more USB ports will cost about $115 at BestBuy.

So, a person could leave the cheaper USB-C dock at home or work connected to a 4K monitor, a mouse, an external HD, Hi-Res DAC/amp for audio, and high speed ethernet > with another port left on the Yoga itself for your mobile phone or Thumb drive. Although many other cheaper PC's had more USB 3.0 and an HDMI port built-in, they had no fingerprint reader or USB-C and were a bit thicker in return.

(2) Unfortunately, the USB-C port doesn't accept power delivery, so in addition to plugging the Yoga into the USB-C dock when you arrive home, you'd have to also plug in the power brick into the round DC power jack on the Yoga.

(3) Not really a complaint, but I do miss having a backlit keyboard. I'm sure my $15 rechargeable book-light would work just fine for typing in the dark, but I can also tap an icon in the task bar and open an onscreen keyboard if it's too dark.

(4) This is slightly irritating but not a deal breaker - there is visible flex to the top case and keyboard when you push down, so if I'm quickly pounding away at the keyboard to type up an email really fast, the center of the keyboard and top case flexes a little, and it can resonate and sound hollow and rattle. If I press down on the top case just to the left of the trackpad then the case is dampened, and there is no rattle when I tap on the keys fast and hard (one-handed pecking). There is no issue when I'm typing slow and gentle, and behaving.

(5) My biggest gripe - the audio quality is poor no matter what. Also, the sound comes out from the bottom and if it's not on a hard surface then the sound can also be muffled. You really should use this with external speakers or headphones if you are an audiophile. It can play loudly without distortion, but the sound is very midrange oriented and it can get irritating, especially at high volumes. Definitely not on the same level as my 15"" retina MacBook Pro. I plan to use my V-MODA Crossfade wireless headphones with it, or a miniJAMBOX if sharing a movie with someone.

(6) In 2nd place for biggest gripe is the automatic screen brightness behavior, which allowed the screen to change from dim to bright and back more often than I would like, with only minor changes in room lighting. This was usually in an already dim room, early evening. 

Sometimes it was depending on whether a cloud was passing by a window, and sometimes it just randomly changed the brightness slightly for no real reason. I had to disable that, and simply use the brightness function button at the top of the keyboard as needed, which is NO problem at all. Fortunately, when enabled it never got too dark or too bright, but having it change for little reason was annoying.","10","0"

"82","Razer - Blade Stealth 13.3"" QHD+ Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive - Black","One of the best ultrabooks","Steph","5","I had been looking for a new laptop for over two years. My old one just couldn't keep up with ever growing college courses worth of work. I realized to get something that would last years and be semi-future proof I would need to get into the ultrabooks range. 

My old laptop was Dell and I just had a bad experience in total. The first hard drive (that came with the laptop) crashes. I lost everything, was able to fix it. Until it crashed again, tried to get it recovered. Turned out the total cost of maybe getting anything back would be buying an ultrabook, so the serious searching began. I was able to google and YouTube my way through buying a new hard drive, formatting it, installing windows and updating every driver. (Side note: I had called Dell customer service because my warranty was out they would have charged me 200 dollars just to see the issue.) 

I only mention this because the Dell XPS had caught my attention when it first came out but the price was exceptionally high and Razer had the same specs for hundreds cheaper. 

At this day and age, choosing between the ultrabook market is very nitpicky. A color, the hinge, the weight, etc. 

I looked at everything, Macs are far too expensive for what they offer. This same laptop with same internals would cost me almost another grand. The same is said for the Microsoft surface line. 

I've had the laptop for about a month now. The battery lasts me about eight hours (5+ window pages, Microsoft word, Spotify playing in the background, power point open and some YouTube videos.) The screen is not 4K but it is exceptionally beautiful and for a 13 inch 4K would be a bit excessive and eat away at the battery life. 

The keyboard may be shallow to some but key spaces are perfect, if you like quiet typing then this is perfect for that. Not much clicking but just enough. 

The track pad is smooth, not jumpy or staggering. Pinch to zoom in or out. There are not dedicated buttons to click but it does press down on the sides. 

The touch screen is responsive and really nothing to complain about, just a nice feature to have. 

The chroma lighting it's definitely a kicker, each key is individually lit and it's honestly the best out there. It looks very clean compared to others I've seen, doesn't hurt your eyes. Though I will say, the max brightness will make you feel like keys are moving. I don't think I see myself ever keeping the keys at max. 

The speed is amazing, boots up in seconds, loads any application just as quick. The SSD is able to open and save things smoothly as well. To push ultrabook to its limits definitely takes some dedication. 

Portability is amazing. Sits at 2.93 pounds. It's small, light and smooth. Opening it up only requires one hand and the bottom has two rubber lines for grip and they work fantastic at keeping the laptop in place while also giving room for the fans to have space. 

Finger print magnet though, anything will attach to the black metal finish. But I am one to put cases on everything and I just bought a matte black skin that just fits in with laptop, unnoticed and provides protection from everyday use. Nicks, scratches, etc. 

There is also the fact that this made by a company that makes gaming laptops, this stealth is not that. It's meant for productivity and it does that amazingly. There is the option of having an external GPU if gaming is an option you'd like. 

There is also a gunmetal grey version that provides are more subtle look, though the keyboard will not have chroma and the logo will not light up. 

This laptop is one of the few that has refreshed to the new 8th gen intel quad core processor which means even more effective and efficient power. 

The laptop under duress does get warm but nothing that's uncomfortable and the fans have no whirring sounds, as that was an issue before but has been fixed. 

Ultimately for my needs and wants this laptop was the perfect fit. The black was a refreshing to all the different greys out there. I can change the key color to whatever I want if I want a more professional look and the logo can be turned on or off. Performance is always top tier and if the eight hours seems short, this is USB-C charged, which means you can take a power bank and easily charge this for another added few hours. Which brings me to ports, compared to others this one is decent. USB-C, two thunderbolt 3 ports and HDMI port. 

Razer's cumtomer service is not the best so to sideline that, I went ahead and bought two years of warranty under Best Buy, that way if anything goes wrong I have peace of mind. (Had too many stressors before.) 

Razer also has a great line of peripherals that go well with there laptops, I bought a mouse and mouse pad from them.

I honestly couldn't be happier, like I said, it's one of the best. If you are in the ultrabook market you know that none of them are going to be cheap, this one is great for everything it offers and sales are always going on. I got 100 dollars off mine. 

Lastly, this model is different, this is the 13.3 inch, the 12.5 inch is different, don't confuse the two!

Hope this helps!","25","3"

For what you get in MacBook for the price I just couldn't justify paying more for less. All I can say is WOW! If your like me you might have been looking at razer products and found out there customer support is garbage, which may be true. I opted to get one through Best Buy so I would have the extended return period and could purchase the geek squad protection. I am truly glad I purchased this laptop. I actually drove to a store 2 hours away to pick it up because no stores in MS had any. The screen is beautiful, its super quite and doesn't really get that hot unless your pushing it, but still its not so hot you cant sit it in you lap. I will admit the first thing I did is load up prime 95 and xtu and ran some tests and this laptop only thermal throttled right off the batt for like a second when it turbo boosted to 4GHZ on the cores. After that it fell back to around 2ghz which the core clock is 1.8ghz and sat there at around 70C on the processors. This is not designed for gaming don't misunderstand, but it is a great laptop for work, and non gaming entertainment, that's built like a brick but lightweight, beautiful to look at and fun to use. For people that don't like the logo you can get a Debrand skin and put on the laptop. They have everything from carbon fiber to leather to wood and you can get one that will totally cover the logo they look really slick.","4","2"

I've been with Apple for 10 years and run both of my business purely from my electronic devices. I bought the brand new Macbook Pro, full specs, and it broke within two weeks. Two of the keys got stuck, the screen was glitchy, battery life wasn't amazing.... not cool for $2000+. I took the plunge and gave windows a try after being fed up with declining quality of apple products. I bought this computer, pretty much expecting not to like it and take it right back... whoa. I LOVE this thing. It has twice the specs of an introductory macbook pro, a FASTER processor, a better screen (touch), and the number one reason I bought this computer, the keyboard! The keyboard is a satisfying, sturdy, well built design that is a joy to type on. 
I thought it would be difficult moving to windows after being with mac for so long, but it really was no big deal. I'm actually pretty impressed with windows 10. It's got a really simple user face with all of the old school windows customization underneath it all.
And a small side note... I really get a feel for the quality of a product right out of the box. This was the most beautifully packaged thing I've ever bought... sounds silly, but wow! So long Apple!","4","1"

I’ve noticed they have been steadily declining in quality and not incorporating new tech, other that minor spec bumps. What finally got me looking for something else was the appallingly bad “butterfly” keyboard. I looked long and hard at MS Surfaces, but they weren’t what I was seeking. Most 13” Windows machines were underpowered or just not what I wanted - until this new generation of Kaby Lake quad-core processors was released. I’d always admired Razer’s look and feel, but I’m not a gamer and not looking to be. I do run Adobe Apps and Ableton Live 10 so I need quad-core power but don’t want to set my pants on fire while I use the machine, either. The Razer gives me the power I want in a wonderfully small package that looks great as a bonus - and I love the Chroma keyboard. No quality issues whatsoever, very little bloatware other than Windows games, and a great experience. Well done, Razer! Here’s to many years together.","3","0"

As soon as Lenovo announced this laptop at MWC and i saw the specs and the price point, then I knew it was going to be worth the wait until it was released in April. 

Overall I was right, now that i have had this lap top a few weeks I absolutely love it! I will go over each category so everyone looking at this laptop can get an idea of how amazing this laptop is for the price.

Build Quality: 10/10 
The entire laptop structure is all aluminium. The back of the lid, the bottom, and the inside. The only thing not aluminium are the keys, but the keys still look and feel very premium. The aluminium is also pretty thick, when pressing on the keyboard area or the lid, then there is barely any flexing. Only thing I would change is wish there was no gap or less gap between the lid and base when it is folded back in tablet mode. But that is a very minor thing. So overall build quality is very premium! 

Performance: 10/10
First let me make sure you all understand a couple things. This is the FIRST 2 in 1 laptop ever with a quad core processor. This is also the FIRST 2 in 1 laptop ever with a 10 series (1050) Nvidia GPU. So this is a ground breaking laptop for the market like no other laptop. With that out of the way, with the combination of the new quad core i7700hq, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, and a Nvidia 1050 GPU, this thing flies!!! I have had multiple chrome tabs open, and multiple applications open, and while playing a video at 4K, and I never saw any frame drops or freezing or stuttering. This machine is very powerful! The fans will of course kick on under moderate or heavy loads, but I have not found the fans to be loud at all. Just a very light swish noise. Barely noticeable at all.

Graphics: 8/10
This is the 1 area I have not really tested. I have not tested any games but it definitely plays 4K videos very smooth. I am not really a gamer on computers, I got this with the graphics so I can edit 4K video in the near future. If you would like to know how the graphics perform on this then just watch any graphics review of the Dell XPS 15 because it has the same processor and same graphics card. So the gaming and graphics performance of this Yoga 720 should be nearly identical to the XPS 15. My only critque of the graphics would be I wish it had 4GB of RAM for the 1050 graphics card (like the Dell XPS 15 has) instead of 2GB RAM. Thats why I knocked ot down to 8/10. BUT that shouldn't affect editing 4K video. This should still be very smooth if you do video editing or 3D rendering. I suspect the only thing that it should effect is very high graphics games (tomb raider, witcher 3, ect), they will maybe be just 2-4 FPS less than the Dell XPS 15 when gaming. So not a huge deal if you aren't a frequent computer gamer.

Display: 9/10
This is a 3840 x 2160 (4K) display. The colors are very accurate. Nothing looks washed out and nothing looks over saturated. The display is very colorful. So it is great for watching 4K videos/movies, and really good for photo editing, and really good for 4K video editing. I wish it was a bit more saturated with color, but that is more of a personal preference.

Keyboard/Track Pad: 9/10
The keyboard is very good! The keys have a shallow travel but not too shallow. Right in that sweet spot I think. There is pretty good tactile feedback with just very light sounding clicks. It is a joy to type on. Some people reported issues with the trackpad having issues. Like it just stops responding until you lift your finger and touch it again. But I have not experienced that on mine. So either that was just a few affected or it was fixed with driver updates earlier. I did experience click and drag not work correctly a couple times, but since this is a Microsoft Precision trackpad driver I am sure any remaining kinks will get worked out very soon. Also this has a finger print sensor to log into Windows with. It has worked flawless every single time!

Battery 8/10
It contains a 72whr battery. So a pretty good size! However since it is a quad core, with discrete graphics, and with a 4K display, then battery times can vary widely if you're doing gaming, rendering, or video editing. According to Windows battery report I have been averaging 5 hours and 36 minutes of screen time which was done with browsing, and media consumption. But when youre doing anything with graphics expect about half that. Overall 5 hours 35 minutes for a 4K display is pretty good!

Input/Output: 8/10
This has 1 USB 3.1 Type C port which also has Thunderbolt 3 support! However I been informed by Lenovo tech support it only has 2 lanes. So only 20GB per second total. The biggest impact that will have means you will only be able to run one 4K external monitor off it, instead of two. That was dsiappointing and I am not sure why Lenovo did that when this has a quad core processor could have handled 4 lanes. Anyways this also has 2 USB type A ports that are 3.0. So that is nice they don't waste space with any old 2.0 ports. Also good because you won't need to use any dongles/adapaters during the market transition to all USB Type c eventually. Having both Type A and C ports, the best of borth worlds! There is no HDMI or Display port, but to me this is okay because the Thunderbolt 3 port can be used as a display port, so no big deal. Also a little dissapointing there is no SD Card slot.

Speakers: 8/10
These are really great speakers that also have Dolby Atmos too. So the speakers are very clear, crisp, and loud! I never noticed any distorition. The only issue I have with them is they are downward facing in laptop mode. They also could use a bit more bass. Still overall they are way better than most laptop speakers.

SUMMARY: So there is only 3 cons about this laptop, the speakers are downward facing instead of upward, the GPU has 2GB instead of 4GB, and the Thunderbolt 3 port has 2 lanes instead of 4. So overall this laptop is really good in every category. There is not 1 aspect of this laptop that sucks or is just okay. So that makes this laptop excellent considering every aspect is really good.

If you compare this Lenovo Yoga 720 to the Dell XPS 15, the specs are nearly identical. Both have a premium build (Lenovo more premium because more aluminium), both have same processor, both have same amount of DDR4 RAM, both have same size PCIe SSD, both have same GPU, and both have 4K resolution displays. The only 3 things the Dell XPS 15 has better is the display has slightly more color range, the battery life is about 20% better, and it has 2GB more of RAM for the GPU. But on the other hand the Lenovo Yoga 720 has a way better webcam cause its better quality and the Lenovo actually has its webcam at the top of the display... instead of at the bottom of the display looking up your nose like the XPS 15 webcam. Also the Lenovo has a little better speakers as well. So considing the Lenovo Yoga 720 and Dell XPS 15 have nearly identical specs with only a couple minor differences, then clearly the Lenovo Yoga 720 is a wayyyy better deal because it is only $1,399 and the XPS 15 with the same specs is $1,999. So almost the same thing for $600 LESS. 

So if youre comparing the XPS 15 and Lenovo Yoga 720, and you want the best deal, then this is by far the better deal for a powerful and beautiful laptop! Also even if money isn't an option and you use your webcam regularly, then I recommend this Yoga 720 over the XPS 15 too.","249","10"
"89","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Quad Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum Silver","Great laptop for the price","Benjamin","4","I purchased this laptop nearly 2 weeks ago in store, and I am in love. I upgraded to this laptop from an HP which I purchased a couple of years ago, and out of the box the difference between the two was immediately noticeable. Whether you purchased this laptop for schoolwork, your job, gaming, or just for casual use, you will not be disappointed. This machine will fulfill all of your needs and then some.

Let's start with the memory. The SSD is wonderful to have, and I really think that this is what makes the laptop so great. Boot times are basically nonexistent for most apps, and the 512Gb storage space is enough to store most of the essentials I need on a computer. Granted, some heavier games or complicated pieces of software might take as much as 30 seconds to completely boot, but this, to me, has been a rare occurrence. For those who wish for a little more storage space, you can purchase a solid 1Tb HDD on amazon for around 60$, which is worth it in my opinion.

The processor is also very nice, in my opinion. The 7th gen i7 Quad Core works wonderfully, I I have no complaints. The 16Gb of RAM is pretty OK for the price, it get's the job done. I feel like 32Gb of RAM would really make this laptop shine, but that's just my own opinion. Windows 10 also works really well (duh), and it runs fine on this laptop. Nothing else to say on the matter. 

The touchscreen is nice, but I haven't really used it much. To be honest, I don't want to smudge the display. I did mess around with it for an hour or so, (and promptly wiped down my screen after I was done) and I find the touch to be very responsive and intuitive. There are some quirks, but I'm sure some of the controls can be remapped within the settings, I didn't really check. The display looks great, there are a few issues that I noticed, but I am going to address them in the graphics card section. 

The graphics card (GPU) in this beast is an NVIDIA GTX 1050. This card probably adds a few hundred bucks onto the cost already, since it is a fairly alright card. It is a little dated, but it will run most games at medium-high graphics perfectly fine. (I tested Witcher 3, No Man's Sky and GTA V and they all ran pretty well at medium-high settings.) The thing is, in addition to the NVIDIA GPU, there is an integrated graphics card (I have no clue as to what it is) and this thing seems to be the default for nearly every application I put onto this thing. This is not nearly as powerful as the NVIDIA card, and has difficulty dealing with higher stress applications. Even with Google Chrome (which was the first thing I downloaded onto this laptop, and I highly recommend any purchaser to do the same) there were some issues. Most prominent was some image fuzziness (which can be attributed to my wireless connection as well) and some screen flickering in-browser. (That's not exactly what happened, it was something more akin to the whites and the grays on webpages flickering every minute or so) There were some issues with gameplay as well, because all of the games I had downloaded onto this laptop were auto-set to run off of the integrated graphics. This was easily remedied by going into the NVIDIA Control Panel and going to ""3D Settings"" and manually selecting the GTX 1050 for all of my most used and most power-hungry applications. I have had no issues since then. The fan is pretty much always running, the laptop can get fairly hot sometimes. (Not surprising) This isn't an issue for me personally, but when running applications with a high graphics requirement the GTX 1050's built in fan can be pretty loud, at least when the application is booting up.

The keyboard is nice and responsive, it feels great to use. I don't personally like touchpads, but thankfully I had a USB mouse. The battery is pretty good, usually will last 30 minutes to an hour over it's estimated time if you're not running very power hungry applications, with a full charge it can last 3-6 hours, based on what you are doing. This is when the computer is on medium-low brightness, and low power mode is off. The backlighting on the keyboard is very nice, I like it. 

This laptop comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports and a USB 3.0 port, all of which I have a use for. I own an external HDD which plugs into the USB 3.0 port, and my mouse takes up one of the USB 2.0 ports. There is no ethernet port, so I had to purchase a USB-Ethernet adapter, which has consumed my final USB 2.0 port. (You can purchase one of these adapters on Amazon for 10-25 dollars, depending on what quality you are looking for). The headphone jack and in-house audio are pretty good, the sound quality is decent for what it is. The Bluetooth functions quite well also. 

The fingerprint reader is a godsend, it makes logging into your computer take only a second or two. You can create a password or a 4 digit PIN as well should you choose not to use the fingerprint reader. Lastly, the wireless on this laptop is pretty good, it connected to my modem just fine. I have noticed a bug where randomly the wireless will disconnect from the modem, and be unable to reconnect even if the network is available, but a hard restart should make this problem go away. There was some bloatware pre-packaged with this computer, but uninstalling it was easy enough. Windows does like to pre-set a lot of stuff for it's users, so I took about an hour to set up my preferences, obviously if you're fine with Window's defaults then you don't have to do this, though I would recommend taking a look around the laptop settings menu just in case. 

Overall, this laptop is pretty decent for the prince it's at, the GPU is amazing and will run nearly anything at medium graphics or above, the screen looks beautiful and the touch is very responsive. The storage is lacking a bit, and there are some issues with it out of the box concerning wireless and the GPU, but these can be easily remedied and have not impacted my experience in an overly negative way. The issues I have had with it, as well as the fact that I have had to purchase an HDD and an ethernet adapter are what prevent me from giving this laptop 5 stars, but if you need a laptop that will run most anything and you don't mid having to deal with some minor glitches, this laptop is for you. For the price I bought it at (on sale, in store, this laptop cost 1300$ with tax) this laptop will do everything you ask of it and more.","24","5"

No reason popped up that would have made me return it and I was definitely looking for a reason to be dissatisfied. Spending 1K on a laptop is quite a commitment and luckily Lenovo made it easy to decide. This laptop is great in many ways: it has an awesome true 4K display (none of that pentile BS) that will get bright enough to make your eyes water. Despite 4K being more or less a luxury and not a necessity, they do generally provide a much higher color gamut accuracy than the FHD screens that normally come with these laptops. Images are clear, sharp, bright, and realistic-looking.

The trackpad is so comfortable that I have been using it rather than my wireless mouse. It is really responsive and precise, with just enough friction to make it usable but not too much that pointing feels rough. The keyboard is okay, I am not a huge fan of it. It is a bit shallow and does not have a 10-key num-pad which is disappointing. On the bright side, it is backlit and otherwise does not get in the way of typing.

Build quality is very good. Whole lotta metal with its powdered aluminum chassis, it feels stiff and durable. Hinges are decent, the display will stay put which ever position you put it though the screen will wobble some when you tap on it. Laptop is a little on the heavy side and is a bit awkward to use in tablet mode due to its weight and bulky 15.6"" size, but that is an issue with any 2-in-1 this size. If you are really big on using tablet mode with a laptop, 13.3"" or smaller is recommended. However, when you do use it, it is pretty amazing scrolling on that large 4K touch display as a tablet, awkwardness and weight aside.

Battery life: When I use it on battery it seems to drain around 15% per hour while doing light productivity work like browsing and watching YouTube with the screen at 75% brightness. I don't really push it beyond that on battery so I can't really say how long a game would run on battery All in all, it meets Lenovo's battery life claims.

No HDMI port, but you could use the USB-C port for video output to HDMI with an adapter. It is Thunderbolt, though limited to 2xPCIe rather than the full 4x. I still have not come across any limitations to this and am not planning on using a eGPU anytime soon though from videos, I have seen it is still possible on 2x.

Fans: They do come on and off with varying speed. However, they have that whisper quiet sound that is not annoying at all. No whine, more white noise-y. Any ambient noise would drown them out.

That black bar issue. The elephant in the room since it is unknown whether it was actually fixed or not. So far, I luckily have not experienced it. I did notice a lot of BestBuy demo units did have it though and one laptop I saw was manufactured as late as Oct 2017. Current units are manufactured much more recently, mine in April 2018. Whether or not this is something that may pop up in the future, I am uncertain. Best recommendation is to check whether you live in the same area as a Lenovo Service Center before buying as it would save the hassle of having to ship to somewhere to get it serviced. It is an issue that Lenovo would cover under warranty.

Performance: This is the main point I wanted to share. Performance is good out of the box but it is NOT fully optimized. You can get better performance using ThrottleStop without doing much besides changing a few settings.

First thing: Undervolt it. This lowers the power voltage going to the CPU and thus reduces heat and throttling. You can undervolt the CPU, CPU cache, and the onboard graphics chip. I have it set to -0.1475, -0.1475, and -0.1826, respectively (note these are NEGATIVE values).

Next thing: ENABLE SpeedShift. For some reason, this isn't enabled by default and cannot be adjusted in the BIOS. Luckily you can turn it on in ThrottleStop. After enabling it, set a value between 0-128. 128 is good for when you use it on battery, 0 is max performance. Basically the CPU will maintain max speeds all the time and not downclock like it does by default. It is great if you use it plugged it and don't have to worry about power consumption. In ThrottleStop you can save separate profiles for AC use and Battery use and I personally have SpeedShift set to 0 and 128, respectively. I have not come across any heat issues using this.

Third thing: You may or may not want to enable TurboBoost. It is disabled by default. TurboBoost would allow you to hit speeds of up to 3.8 GHz. Combined with SpeedShift set to 0, the laptop will be running at around 3.6 GHz all the time. The only issue with TurboBoost is that if you are doing a high-intensive task over an extended period of time, you will hit high temps that will cause the CPU to throttle itself. If you are doing a lot of gaming, it is better to leave it disabled. For day-to-day light productivity like browsing, enabling it will make programs open faster and work more smoothly. Of course you can set separate profiles for these different uses in ThrottleStop.

For a better tutorial on all this stuff, I recommend watching OWNorDisown's videos on Youtube. He specifically uses this laptop as a guide to Undervolting and also provides benchmarks on all the effects of these settings in his laptop review. Highly recommend checking it out.","4","0"

Basically, my old Dell laptop died so I needed a replacement. I hadn't purchased a laptop in 5 years so I researched. As a Net Admin, I've supported IBM/Lenovo, Dell, and HP laptops in the past and have had good luck with all those manufacturers. I didn't rule out second-tier vendors such as Asus but they weren't my core focus. Don't get me wrong, if there was a second-tier vendor that met my requirements at a compelling cost point (which there wasn't), I would have considered it.

My requirements:
15.6"" screen, quad core processor, 12GB RAM (minimum), about $1,000, and a tactile keyboard/trackpad that didn't feel mushy. SSD was a nice to have but I do a lot of Photoshop so I wanted a bigger hard drive.

Why those requirements worked for me:
For me, 13"" screens are too tiny and 17"" screens are too massive. I tend to keep my laptops a long time so a quad core would help keep things running swiftly, even with a constant onslaught of patches, security updates, and fatter software applications. In addition to Lightroom/Photoshop, I do some light gaming as well. As you know, there are a ton of different laptop configurations/sizes/pricing out there. My requirements may not work for you (maybe you want a 17"" screen, totally fine) but those listed requirements work perfectly for me.

Why I chose the Yoga 720:
As you see, my requirements were really specific and frankly, there weren't a lot of options to choose from. As I researched, it eventually dawned on me I might as well get a 2-1/convertible laptop. The price was a little more, true, but it gave a lot more flexibility how I could use the device (tablet mode, etc.) 

Yoga 720 v. HP Spectre:
I really struggled deciding between these two laptops. The quad core HP Spectre with its gold trim is the sexiest laptop on the planet. It has comparable stats, beautiful curves, good weight, and definitely looks better than the Yoga 720 from an eyeball standpoint. There were two problems with the Spectre: 1) The model I wanted was over $1,500 (this was at Best Buy, January 2018) and 2) the HP Spectre trackpad was by far the most frustrating trackpad I have ever used. The trackpad is just too big for its own good, left clicks turn into right clicks, etc. Super annoying. I really tried to enjoy the Spectre but the trackpad killed all enjoyment. What should have been joy degraded to frustration. 

Yoga 720 Use:
I've owned the 720 about a month and love it. I just wish it came in the darker color like the Yoga 710. I think I paid around $1,200 for it (again, Best Buy, January 2018).","5","2"

It is big...you don't notice it as a laptop, but in tablet mode, and converting it back and forth, it is a little cumbersome. Smaller hands should watch out--be sitting down on a couch/bed, or at a table when converting it so there's a soft landing if you drop it. Make sure you have a good hold on it. I usually use it in tablet mode when sitting and using a Lenovo Pen, and have another book open.
As a laptop, the keys feel nice and responsive.

The 4k display is really nice. The text clarity is awesome..I was going to go with the 1080 version, but the text on the 4K did it. I did run through the ClearType set up in Windows to get it how I want it.

Yes..the sound isn't there...you need headphones or an external speaker.
I wasn't getting it for that. I needed a fast CPU, NVME drive, 2 in 1, >13 but <17 "" screen.
When you research these laptops, you can't just see what CPU it has, then go on Intel's site and see the specs. Manufacturers lock down the speed to keep heat down, and battery up.
You have that here too...Turbo mode is disabled.

Ok with that..FAN NOISE--yep...you know why? The cooling system is not effective in pulling heat off the the CPU/GPU. In this machine, it simply came down to the thermal paste between the processors and the heatsink...it is either it is poor quality and/or not optimally applied.

Do this...obtain a small tube of Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Thermal Grease Paste - 1.0 Gram. Pay Geeksquad $40 to re-paste the CPU and GPU with the large-blob method, or do yourself..only if you are highly experienced, and already own a high-quality T5 screwdriver, and ArctiClean 1 and 2.
Excessive fan noise gone. Really. Instead, just a slow steady heat coming out the back. Fan only kicks up some (not full blast) when running my database analysis, then back down due the that great Intel Speed Shift Technology!
So, the fan can now remove more heat at lower speeds.


Ok great..how do we get our Turbo and higher speeds that i7700HQ is capable of back? You can supposedly enable the Turbo mode in the BIOS.
Instead, Google the article about Throttlestop by Douglas Black. Safe, step-by-step with instructions (although, I do keep BD PROCHOT enabled.) 

I have a ""new"" machine. I almost never hear the fan..only when a research app I run is doing a massive data search and analysis..it kicks up a little bit. Meanwhile, a quiet, steady stream of warm air goes out the back when running intermediate horsepower requiring programs....and temps never reach what they did before the thermal repasting. Temps down. Speeds up. Battery life up. (I'm in battery mode now, with 18% remaining and 1hr 20 min left, doing internet work...and yes, its been accurate.)

You want to kick it out the park? (although, too expensive I think for the return)...people worry about the SSD speed throttling. In normal use, you probably won't have or notice this at all. But if you are pickayune , and must sleep at night...pick up a $22 pack of 1.5mm Fujipoly thermal strip (I told you expensive.) Gamersnet has shown that you want to cool the SSD controller, not the storage chips. They like some heat. So, while Geeksquad is repasting your CPU/GPU, have them cut 2 pices off the strip the size of the Polaris controller chip by the SSD connector, and stack them on top of the Polaris chip. That 3mm will juuuust nicely contact the strip of GrafTech eGRAF® SPREADERSHIELD™ SS500 Graphite that Lenovo has attached to the inside of the aluminum casing, without exerting damaging downward force on the chip (I have calipers to measure ;) . Now that is some heat spreading for the Polaris chip! I havent stress tested my drive to see the highest temp (I want it to last), but there is a slightly warm area under the laptop right at that spot..so it is working.

Love it. Got one for my highschooler video creator for his Sony Vegas, and one for me to replace my 6-year old Asus that really wasn't made to be a ""laptop."" I use the Yoga on the couch, outside bench, desk, etc. When using it in laptop mode and doing research with other books open, I type, use the pen, and hit the touchscreen..with all the input methods available, my workflow has increased significantly.","5","0"
"93","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Quad Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum Silver","Nice laptop, but not perfect","Bevo0000","4","First let me say I purchase and use a lot of hardware, Macs and PC's
I purchased this specifically for a .NET development project I am working at the moment so my needs were 
- Performance
- Nice screen
- Nice keyboard/trackpad
- Complete MS stack compatibility 

Secondary needs were battery life and weight

General observations

This is not a Macbook by any means. It does come closer than most PC's I have used, but in the end of the day it is still Windows and a PC with all that entails. However, if you are on a budget and want something nice that is fast or you just need to be in the Microsoft ecosystem, this is a good buy.

Cons
Not many but I have noticed a couple of quibbles
- Fan noise, if you leave the fan setting in the BIOS on its default performance setting the fan kicks in if the CPU's are at 25% utilization or higher and they can be noisy. You can switch to balanced mode which did cut the fan noise down at the cost of performance. When I benchmarked it in Geekbench, switching to balanced knocked about 10-15% off the performance numbers which isn't terrible but if you want maximum performance leave it at its defaults.
- The screen resolution is awesome for those apps that support it. I have found though that many Windows apps do not render properly. Some are super tiny and some are a bit fuzzy! 4K still seems to be in transition.
- Windows (however, I will say Windows 10 is a big improvement over Windows 8 and I will dare say it is almost enjoyable)

Now Pros

-Performance is great. Compilatation time is way down, apps are snappy, tested one or two games and the GTX1050 is very fast. This thing is packing a real processor
instead of the ultra low power parts that dominate most Windows machines at Best Buy at least. 
- Keyboard is excellent
- Trackpad for Windows laptop is very good, but still nothing compared to a Mac. Apple just has the trackpads nailed.
- Screen, very clear, beautiful screen, apps look fantastic that properly scale to handle 4K
- Laptop is light, won't break your back
- Quality of construction.. seems very well made. No flex in the screen or body, no rough edges or shoddy work
- Very nicely packaged ( nice job Lenovo on the packaging)

Unknowns
- Battery life, just haven't tested it yet, but I think it is going to average 5 or 6 hours which isn't bad
- How long will it last.. hard to say with laptops. Again for my Macs, I know I am going to get a solid 4-5 years out them no question, but
Windows laptops it is a mixed bag. I have one Windows laptop that is still going after 8 years and now is a decent Linux machine and others that have died in the 
first year. 

Summary

This is a very nice Windows laptop and for the price it is hard to beat.","38","7"
"94","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Quad Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum Silver","It is quite a machine","Kadeo69","4","I had such a hard time choosing between the 720 and HPSpectre that I bought them both, fully loaded, 4k res, 16gig etc. I like to mess with stuff and my wife likes to keep things factory fresh and has a thing for HP so I gave her the spectre and kept the yoga. She works at home on the computer and the absolutely adores the HP. Its a very fine machine and the quality of fit and finish are impeccable. Everything works out of the box and we both prefer the keyboard on hers more than mine. Even the backlit keys look better on the HP.
So fit and finish and keyboard are both wins for the spectre.

Sound quality we both agree that the Yoga just totally outclasses the Spectre. We were both surprised and guessed wrong before comparing. The speakers on the yoga have the openings on the bottom and they just dont appear to be in a logical place at all. The HP appears to have a million places for sound come from. We tweaked settings and compared all sorts of things. Honestly, we tried everything we could think of to make the HP even come close to the yoga in sound quality, range and volume. Using only the internal speakers the Yoga wins by 2 miles.

Reliability, that goes to the HP. There have been zero issues for the spectre in almost 2 months of steady use 8 hrs a day on a daily basis. Its almost too reliable for comfort. The yoga not so much. Its hard to bash the lenovo as I stated that I like to tinker, but out of the box it had some issues staying connected to wifi and it would occasionally go to sleep and not wake up without doing a power button restart. An update along the way or something I cant explain made that all get better. I upgraded to win10 pro and joined the insider program active development fast pace. I also installed throttlestop to try and workaround the 2.8ghz max that lenovo set for the only quad core i7 to be put in a 2 in1 so far. I know its to keep from overheating anything but thats like buying a porsche and only using low octane fuel. Why???
My point being I had a complete failure and with the upgraded 3 yr warranty with onsite repair through lenovo, I got a recovery flash drive at no cost and a tech dispatched to repair it here in the middle of nowhere within 72 hrs. I got it back up and running with the flash drive myself before the tech got to my house. Thank god because lenovos answer was a replacement motherboard. We both agreed that usually causes more issues than it fixes and since it passed all the tests we agreed to send the replacement back. Now with a little undervolting and this and that with throttlestop it purrs like a kitty at a steady 3.4ghz and stays under 90deg during a solid 8 thread benchmark. 

I have not had the screen issue that many have reported as of yet. The performance of the quad core i7 is obvious if you have it doing identical tasks along side the HP. The geforce 1050 outperforms the HPs although I wish it was a 1050ti or had 4gig of dedicated memory.

I really like them both but prefer my yoga. The active pen on the HP is a kids toy, but better than what lenovo doesnt include. I got a wacom stylus for mine and its just awesome. I wish the lenovo had some more ports and got rid of the stupid lenovo only charger. That never crossed my mind until I realized the wife accidently charging her hp with the USB-C cord from my nexus phone and not having an issue.There are a couple imperfections in the way seems join on the lenovo and the HP is flawlessly assembled. I dont think I have ever seen a laptop of any sort as beautifully assembled as the HP. 
I have just gotten attached to my yoga that could. It will do anything I can throw at it and do it well and do faster than anything its found to challenge it. Multiple videos playing, High detail graphics programs, file conversion. Its just super fast. The 4k screen is only noticably better when next to a non 4k screen. Both machines are useless outdoors due to reflection off the glossy gorilla glass. 

All and all I say if you want something that does what its supposed to do and do it consistently the same you should go with the HP. If you want a machine that outruns everything when its tuned up but you have to replace the spark plugs and check the timing and air in the tires to get that every time the yoga wins. The Dell XPS instantly forfeits the race with webcam someone decided to put at the bottom of the screen. Who would trade an invisible bezel for a webcam that shows anything but a snotty nose.","2","0"
"95","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Quad Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum Silver","Glorified video player - massive amount of issues","AnOldDude","1","When trying to replace my current laptop with the Lenovo 720 (model 15IKB) I run in so many issues that I can only imagine that this product was rushed into production by Lenovo. Here is a recollection of the nightmare of the past few days:

1) The Thunderbolt 3 connection is not a fully functional one, for many reasons. First, its data transfer rate is only 20 Gps (and not the full 40 Gps). This isn’t a problem per se but buyers for sure are expecting a true Thunderbolt 3 – i.e. Lenovo is not being fully honest with their customers.

2) Also, you can’t charge the Lenovo 720 (model 15IKB) using the Thunderbolt port – again, most customers would for sure assume it would be able to charge the laptop, as this is one of the key new features of this connection type.

3) The lower speed shouldn’t be an issue, however, to transfer enough info to plug many extra 1920x1080 monitors (as of now I have three monitors running on a laptop that has only USB 3.0 ports – and is 6 years old!). This was not the case with the Lenovo 720 – I tried many different connectors (to HDMI and DVI monitors, some very high-end, like the triple display docking station from Plugable) and the quality was just poor – even simple spreadsheets and finance-related software (think Bloomberg) were showing numbers that were difficult to read.

4) One of the most bizarre issues I experienced was with Excel crashing if moving to a worksheet with reasonably complex charts. I use my laptop to perform heavy financial analysis (some spreadsheets are more than 2 Gb when opened – but my 6 years old laptop can handle it). However, running Office 2016 64-bit, was almost impossible. Not only because of the bizarre crashes when trying to display charts, but also due to how slow the cursor and cells selections, even in a data-only spreadsheet, would move. I of course re-installed Office 2016 multiple times as I couldn’t believe that the laptop could be so badly projected/built – it didn’t solve the issue. 

5) Also, a myriad of software just wouldn’t work, regardless of how many times I re-installed them (many times with the help desk of the software company remotely connected to my laptop). For instance, I use a software called CompanionLink to sync my Google calendar/contacts/tasks with Outlook (although it is unbelievable that in 2017 one needs extra software to link a Google product to a Microsoft product). No matter what was done, this software wouldn’t work. The finance-related info software I was using, on top of showing low-resolution charts and figures, had a series of formatting issues of very simple menus – making it almost impossible to use. Also, a key feature of this finance software is to allow the user to download P&L / balance-sheet data released by companies – I couldn’t make it work (again, software re-installed multiple times with a company’s IT expert helping).

6) Finally, dragging and moving a software window (even a simple folder from windows File Explorer) from monitor to monitor, was a nightmare – a small window on the laptop would show-up as a gigantic window on a lower-resolution monitor, until you managed to make the window fit completely on the new window. This could be a Windows 10 bug, but given how many issues I had with this laptop, I’m assuming it is Lenovo’s fault.

I guess you got the picture – nothing worked with this laptop. I consider myself a very savvy user – although I’m not an IT professional, I have been configuring and installing software/peripherical devices to my machines for many years. And I never had a worse experience than the one with this laptop from Lenovo. Returning it tomorrow. [quick note: Best-Buy’s return process was excellent – the person was very polite and took the defective laptop without any harassment].

Lastly, I will eventually need to upgrade my laptop. However, I strongly recommend that you stay away from this product (or any other from Lenovo) – they are selling a laptop that is basically a glorified video player (yes, when not plugged to anything, Netflix would play very well…). I’m looking now for an alternative – the Dell XPS 15 Touch came really close to satisfy my needs (i.e. very good processing power but still portable). However, I really don’t understand why Dell didn’t make this model with a 360-degree screen – a touchscreen laptop that you can’t use on a tablet mode? And you wouldn’t believe where they put the laptop camera (it is worthwhile checking it out: search for “Dell XPS 15 chin action” on Youtube!). For sure another case of a company rushing into production…

If someone has a suggestion of a laptop with a i7 processor as good as the 7700HQ (or better; be careful with the ones with 7500U or lower – these processors are marginally better than my laptop bought 6 years ago), that has a touchscreen that turns 360-degrees (I still can’t believe that Dell didn’t have this on the XPS 15…) and have at least one true Thunderbolt 3, please respond to this posting with your suggestion!","6","5"

I purchased the top of the line model (QHD, 16GB - 8GB onboard+8GB DIMM, 512 NVMe SSD) from BestBuy and purchase 3 years additional onsite and accidental damage warranty from Lenovo. And then got 15 BSODs in 2 weeks. Got a replacement from BestBuy which worked fine for a couple of weeks and then BSODs started again. And the well known black line on the top right corner of screen. And issues with external display, screen flickering, use with Active Pen 2 (purchased separately from Lenovo). I have been in communication with Lenovo for the past 4 months, resulting in 2 remote access to my computer by technicians (who saw the number of BSODs on the event viewer), a carry-in repair at Geek Squad where the black line on the screen was supposedly fixed (it is back again) but the other issues were found to be non-existent as opposed to that experienced first hand by remote access technicians, a sent-to-depot repair where the laptop was kept for more than 35 days where apparently the only problem the team found was a heating issue .... the problems still exist. Oh! and I received a printed page with the return of my laptop from the depot saying that the laptop was returned unrepaired because the customer refused repair - when it was the case manager who requested that I take the laptop back and see if the issues still exists. 

And the icing on the cake is that never did Lenovo reach out to me with any update on their own. I had to always contact them either on chat or phone and coax information out of them. Imagine my surprise when during a period in those 35 days on depot repair - I was told that the repair was kept on hold because the team needed more information from the customer - and no one bothered to contact me for more than 4 days! 

Even after escalation of the case to the case manager(s) (one of whom completely stopped responding to any email or phone calls once the laptop got back from the depot), and repeated requests to Lenovo to contact me in proper timeframe, at the very least within the period they promise, I am still waiting to hear back from them regarding an onsite repair that they are going to set-up (apparently that's the best solution they can offer) even though I was promised that I would be hearing a confirmation within 24 hours. At present, I am on the 38 hour mark.","8","1"

Unreliable.","Elle","2","I really wish I could recommend this laptop as I am bummed out about having to return it after investing a great deal of time researching which to get, but this model didn't have many reviews at the time for me to rely on. The 4k screen is beautiful (although it could be a bit brighter) and the 2 in 1 touchscreen feature is fun and cool, but neither matter when the hardware was thoughtlessly placed. The first issue for me was the laptop froze while watching youtube. No big deal, I restarted. It happened again a few days later, and I'm not sure why since a quad core 16gb processor with a dedicated graphics card should be able to handle YouTube. For video editing and gaming experience, I didn't have issues aside from how hot the laptop got, I was a little concerned but dealt with it. The fans kick in loudly as expected with tasks requiring power, and it stays idle with an occassional boost otherwise. I would have endured these issues had it not been for the screen defect randomly appearing on my 9th day of having the laptop. A slight black bar showed up in the top right corner and after looking it up on online forums, it seemed to have happened with other users too and even their exchanged models after a few weeks of use. So, even though this laptop is relatively beautiful and sleek and fun to use, it was glitchy and the build had minor imperfections(hinges uneven, bottom and one corner were not seamlessly joined, protruding lip when closed) that made it clear this wasn't a macbook, which is fine as that alternstive would cost more, but it still should not have at this price point. I am disappointed and frustrated by this experience of a laptop that *could* be great. Overall, I would recommend waiting for the next version of this laptop so all the kinks are worked out, keeping an eye out on other reviews and getting another laptop, or buying the lower priced version of the 720 if you don't need 4k and the power. I really really wanted this laptop to last me a few years and am disappointed in having to return it and had so many issues at this price point that can only be blamed on poor quality control/design implementation. Oh and no pen was included, just an empty pen box.","27","11"

I occasionally game, watch youtube videos, do picture editing and school work. Primarily school work. I run programs such as visual basic, standard office, wireshark, etc. It handles all of these great, but the black line on the top of the screen that I've had on three of these machines now is just ridiculous. Why has Lenovo not recalled these panels yet? I have gone through two machines in under, let me state that again, UNDER a WEEK. I cannot believe that Lenovo will not listen to their community, with the multiple complaints of dead pixels on this review site, as well as the 48+ pages of complaints from others on the community forum. I know this is somewhat of a rant, but it degrades a company's image when they don't listen to their customers.

Pros 
- Screen is beautiful. . . when it works
- 2 in 1 hinge is buttery smooth
- Keyboard backlighting is bright, sometimes overpowering
- Easy to get 8+ hours on battery life

Cons
- Storage speed is ungodly slow at times
- Auto rotation has a mind of its own when switching to tent/tablet mode
- Trackpad tracks nicely, but the button presses sound like slamming a piece of metal onto a table.
- The machine tends to not want to shut down very fast, 1-2 minutes. 
- Hinge has a weird cracking noise when first opening, only the right side
- Dead row of pixels on multiple machines

Images attached are two separate machines.

It's sad to have a Lenovo product I didn't like, I've had multiple. I even still have and use a Lenovo v570, still have it working as if it were new. Most durable machine I have ever owned. Unfortunately I guess Lenovo has lost touch with those roots, because this machine is anything but.","1","0"

When it comes to laptops, everything is a trade-off. You can have small and lightweight with a less powerful processor or get something beefier and sacrifice those things along with battery power. However, this laptop strikes an excellent balance. As far as know, it's the only 2 in 1 on the market with a quad core i7 and a GTX 1050 graphics card. 

I didn't know how much I would make use of tablet mode, but it is quite handy for watching Netflix in bed or browsing the web sitting on the couch. While it is huge for a tablet, it actually works fine in that role if sitting down with it. My complaints about tablet mode are on the Windows side, MS still has yet to build in critical functionality needed to support 2 in 1s well.

I have only done limited gaming on it, but it's great so far. I've played Bioshock Infinite at max 1080p settings and it plays almost flawlessly. It's impressive to see this kind of game performance in a more professional, thin profile laptop. It would have been unheard of only a couple of years ago. Thunderbolt 3 is two lanes only, but that's enough to support eGPUs in the future if connecting to an external display. The cases are ridiculously overpriced now, but consider that in < 2 yrs you will likely be able to get an eGPU case with a GTX 1060 or 1070 for < $200. However, if you're a casual gamer and care more about being able to play fun games than having the max possible graphics, the 1050 is already a solid performer.

The SSD performance has been blazing fast and CPU is great. Note that you should install throttlestop. Turbo boost is turned off by default, but you can manually turn it on and undervolt the cpu when not gaming for more performance. See youtube for more info. Lenovo turns off turbo boost because performance drops way off with the heat produced by that in combo with the graphics card on. It's a thermal trade off that you can manually control.

As far as I can tell closest competitors to this system are the hp Spectre x360 15"" and the Dell XPS 15"". The spectre is a fantastic form factor, but is only a dual core CPU with a much weaker graphics card. The XPS 15 is a great machine, but there are wide reports of QC issues and a similarly equipped model is $1800 right now. It's also not a 2 in 1 and doesn't support a digital pen and importantly, has an inferior keyboard. I got the Yoga for $1250 and it's very close in build quality to the XPS 15, making it an easy decision.

You can't go wrong with this laptop at this price point.","2","0"

First off I am very pleased with the price. For an i7 (7700HQ) Processor, 16GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 1050 2GB graphics card, 4k display, and 512GB SSD, It's a really great deal. The battery is about as solid as a laptop battery can be. I generally get about 6 hours with the brightness down and while using the integrated graphics. While gaming I only get about two and a half hours but not bad considering how intensive gaming can be on a laptop. The sound is pretty crisp and isn't as tinny as most other brands are. Tablet mode is a little bit awkward just because of its size and how bulky it can be. I didn't find that to be an issue as I didn't buy this for the tablet feature. Others may or may not enjoy it. Overall I've found this to be an incredible machine. At 1300 dollars, it's pricy and there are prettier laptops out there however, you won't find them with these kind of specs for this price range! It's a great entry level gaming device with plenty of potential. Games play butter smooth in 1080 and I've gotten a few games to run in native 4k. Heat can be an issue while gaming so keep that in mind. I've never had it restart on me but it gets into the upper 80s on both the cpu and the gpu. Weirdly enough, it runs drastically less hot while playing games on battery. Something about plugging it in and playing games makes it heat up pretty badly. I haven't repasted anything yet but I've heard that helps quite a bit. I use a laptop cooler and I've gotten the Temps down by almost 10 degrees in some cases. Get a good one if you're planning on playing AAA games. If you're thinking about buying this, DO IT! It's definitely a powerful machine and I'm so in love with mine! It's a compact little powerhouse!

I develop websites, edit large format images, and videos. This Lenovo Yoga 720 15in 4k is incredible for what I need it for and more. For under $1500 this is the best laptop in the market as of 9/2017. The power in this laptop Compared to a Macbook pro would set me back $2400, and it would not have a TOUCH SCREEN, only a buggy touch bar. Mega fail there for me as an Apple consumer, and even though a desktop is better for the work I do, I need to be mobile, and this laptop does it for me. Windows 10 is a beautiful Os and major upgrade from the last time I use it (Windows 95, LOL), that it was easy to adjust coming from Mac os sierra. This laptop has a beautiful 4K display that is a touch screen, which I find myself using a lot when I extend to multiple displays. I can't believe Apple users haven't been able to use a touch display all these years on their macs. In addition to using the 4k touchscreen, you can use a Wacom pen and edit photos right on the screen. Its a great experience having to use a screen and not a Wacom tablet to edit pictures. Overall coming from a Macbook pro ( every generation model) I'm pleased with the Lenovo Yoga 720 15in 4k in a very big way, and if you're a die-hard Apple user like I once was, I recommend this laptop for those who need a better performance out of their current MacBook Pros.

Pros:
-Quad-core processing
-Nvidia Geforce Gtx 1050 graphics card
-4k Touchscreen
-Minimal Design
-Great Keyboard for typing
-Finger touch is fast 
-Flip and fold is great for using it as tablet mode or external touch display
-Lightweight considering the size and specs
- $1499 at this price its a no brainer, only other laptop that comes close is a Dell XPS but its $400 more. 
Jbl Sound speakers are nice and loud.

Cons:
-Yoga, this name for a laptop is killing me and turning people off. Lenovo, Change it and your sales will soar.
-16gb ram, now I know its good but 32gb is better and being able to add additional ram to it will also make this a no-brainer purchase.
- Trackpad is good, but this is where Apple is leading the way
- Battery life is decent, could be improved but the 4k screen is probably taking up most of the power so it's understandable.","1","0"

It looks sleek and beautiful, and the 4K display will knock you out when you're looking at it in the store. It has a really nice-looking backlit keyboard with a pleasant touch; even the box it comes in is really, really pretty. 

But don't be swayed by its looks. There's some kind of incompatibility between the 4K display and the NVidia GeForce that makes the whole screen flash to black in certain applications (like every. single. web. browser--mostly Opera and Firefox, but it also does it in Chrome and Edge). Sometimes the flashing is so bad I have to quit using it and just go do something else, which isn't very conducive to getting stuff done. Older software might not work with the 4K display, btw; it shows up as a tiny, unreadable rectangle in the corner of the screen. (I will say that these could both be related to Windows 10; I haven't noticed either of them when running Ubuntu in VirtualBox, but I don't do that very often.)

Forget using it with an external display. There's no HDMI output (which most modern external displays want), so you're looking at an adapter at minimum; I haven't found either a USB-to-HDMI or a USB-to-DVI for under $50 that will work, and personally, I consider spending that much on an adapter throwing good money after bad. You can get a cheaper USB-C to HDMI adapter, but since it only has the one USB-C port--and that's the one you use to charge it--you can't use it plugged in with an external monitor. In trying to figure out how to solve this, I found a comment on a forum from a Lenovo tech that indicates that you just can't use it with an external monitor. AWESOME.

It's heavy, but also slick, so it's hard to tote around without fear of dropping it. It runs really hot (weird, since it has an SSD) and is just not comfortable to use. 

I wish I had returned it and eaten whatever processing fee Best Buy charges. I pretty much hate everything about it except the pretty silver Yoga logo. It's not bad in tablet mode, however, and the hinges are nice and tight so it works well that way. That's the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one.","1","0"

There is an entire 67-page forum on the Lenovo website full of people that have had a thick black line appear across the top of the screen. These are not dead pixels, but rather the result of a sheet inside the screen slipping out of place. This issue happens within a few weeks of purchasing the product, regardless of how well you take care of it. I was fortunate enough to be within the return date and had mine replaced by Best Buy, only to have the EXACT same issue occur within a few weeks. 

Note: The forum page has been marked as solved, when it has not. Check out the link to see how many people have had this issue, only to have their laptop replaced with another defective unit. Other people have attempted to have the machine repaired numerous times, only to have the same dreaded line appear. It appears that nobody on the forum has been able to resolve this issue, unless replacing this laptop with a completely different model counts. This does not seem to be an issue with the cheaper, Full HD model of this laptop (though that model does not have a GTX 1050 in it).

All of this aside, the machine has a great battery life, can run high-end games on low-to-mid graphics, and has quiet fans that keep the system relatively cool. It would be perfect as a mid-tier laptop, were it not for a glaringly apparent black line across the screen.","5","0"

Smaller size is nice, but honestly not the most important factor. I had looked at the Dell XPS and the HP Spectre 360, but I wanted a 15 inch screen, and the Spectre seemed to have a lot of issues in that size. The XPS was more than I wanted to spend, so I thought found a nice compromise in the Lenovo Yoga. 

It is indeed relatively lightweight, and the flip around touch screen is nice. However, because of its flexibility, the screen shakes slightly when you type, and the glossiness of the screen means that there's too much of a reflection on any site with a darker background. 

The biggest problem for me though is that the laptop constantly sounds like it's about to overheat and shut down. It's VERY loud, even when all I'm running is a single open tab on the internet. My ROG laptop did not do this. My Dell Latitude E7470 that I use for work does not do this. It's overly warm when it's actually sitting on my lap, and the fan runs constantly even when the laptop is placed on a hard, flat surface. I have yet to install Microsoft Office or Adobe Creative Suite, so I can only imagine how awful the noise will be then.

I had hoped there was a simple fix for this, but Lenovo's responses to reviews here seem to indicate that this is a normal state for the laptop. I'm incredibly disappointed that I spent this much money on a laptop that sounds like it's going to overheat and die at any second.

I will be returning this to Best Buy and getting something else instead. This will likely be the last time I buy a Lenovo.","1","0"

The main requirement was a 4K screen for more real estate, powerful but efficient quadcore CPU and PCIX4 NV-SSD. Great battery life would be a bonus, but who am i kidding?

Once you remove most of the bloatware, including the Dolby Atmos and Lenovo Settings app, which places the laptop on auto brightness and making it impossible to enjoy this beautiful screen, you will find that it's a pretty nice laptop.

The battery last just as long as my 2015 MacBook Pro. I was on 7hrs, 21 mins with 22% still showing on the battery meter. My 2016 Y700 is a pig when it comes to battery life and can barely muster 3.5 hrs!SO big props to Lenovo on this one!

I added a StarTech USB 3.0 dock which provides support for an additional 4K monitor ( I ordered a 
LG 34UC98-W 34"" Monitor) , 2 1080p monitors, 5 USB 3.0 ports, a headset jack, separate 3.5mm audio and microphone ports, as well as an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet port. It requires no driver and plugs into the USB 3.0 on the right side. I added a usb-c to 3.0 dongle so i can leave a wireless mouse radio installed perm on the USB 3.0 port on the right. 

My only real gripe this only has a single memory slot. I have to wait until a 32gb SODIMM module is available to increase from 16gb to 32gb. I still haven't opened her up yet to see if i can add an additional drive like my Y series has, so sorry i cannot confirm it.

All in all i think when looking at the playing field, this provides a lot great value and future proofing.","11","7"

+Flexible as a 2-in-1 and very portable
+Included S-Pen works well and stores in the case
+Comfortable keyboard and accurate touchpad
+Has a USB-C port that supports charging
+Excellent build quality

Cons
-Battery life is only average
-Some bloatware, especially Samsung apps
-Speakers could have more bass

Summary
This is a very good 2-in-1 from Samsung. It doesn't have any noticeable weak spots. It has a good mix of ports that includes USB-C, is light, and very well constructed. The pricing is on par as well when compared to others with similar build quality. This device is recommended for daily use, business travelers that want an ultrabook but with a larger screen, and students.

Background
I picked up the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro 15 with Intel 8th Gen CPU from my local Best Buy. I wanted a travel friendly Windows 2-in-1 with a good screen, keyboard, touchpad, USB-C compatibility, and battery life. My daily driver to this point has been a 2017 MacBook Pro 15 with Touch Bar and I have been testing out many recent Windows laptops including the 2017 models of the Dell XPS 13 (regular and 2-in-1), 2017 ThinkPad X1 Carbon, 2017 Surface Pro, 2017 Galaxy Book, 2017 Spectre x360 13, and others. My thoughts are based on being a frequent business traveler that spends a lot of time in Microsoft Office & Office 365 and the web. I also play some light games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends.

Design
I really like the design. It's a professional and clean silver aluminum body with a dark interior that makes the key lettering pop. The hinges are sturdy and fairly firm to minimize screen wobble. Fingerprints tend to show up on the inside in the keyboard deck area, but are easy to wipe clean. The rounded edges of the body make it easy to carry and nothing digs into your hands. It weighs under 4 pounds, is thin, and very easy to carry around or toss into a bag. The fit and finish is excellent.

Display
The laptop comes with a 15-inch touchscreen at 1080p resolution. It looks good and I think is still an adequate resolution for this screen size. A higher resolution would draw more power and I don't think the tradeoff is worth it for a mobile device. Plus, there is less of a chance of running into Windows text scaling issues. While it doesn't have the thinnest bezels, they are still quite slim and look good. Light bleed is a little more noticeable on this model versus the 13.3 inch model I also own. Text and video are both clear and HDR is supported. The panel is pleasing to look at and is plenty sharp for standard use.

Input devices
The 3-stage backlit keyboard has a good amount of travel, is relatively quiet, and is easy to type on. My biggest gripe with it is the fact that functions like volume and screen brightness are not the default action for the function key row. I checked the BIOS and there doesn't seem to be a way to enable these by default. The touchpad glides well and makes a satisfying click. It supports gestures and tracks accurately. The device includes the S Pen that slides into the case which is very convenient so you always have it with you and you don't have to worry about figuring out how to attach or secure it to the device like other similar devices. The S Pen does not require batteries and while thin, provides a good mark-up experience. Having used the Apple Pencil and new 2017 Surface Pen, I find it works just as well as those two for casual use.

Ports
2 USB 3.0
1 HDMI
1 DC Power (1.5mm)
1 USB-C that supports charging and display port - Note - I use the Apple USB-C to HDMI adapter to charge the device and plug it into my monitor with one cable.
1 Headphone/Mic combo port
1 micro SD card

Audio
There are two downward firing speakers on the bottom of the case that get loud enough. The audio is clear, but there is a distinct lack of bass that is common in most laptops. They are fine most casual use, but not as good as the newer MacBook Pro models which have amazing audio.

Performance
A quad core i7-8500 powers the device and I have not run into any issues with daily tasks. It scored a 4883 on the single core and 14691 on the multi-core Geekbench 4 tests, which is on par with the 2017 MacBook Pro 15's i7-7700HQ processor. There are switchable integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics which are ok for light games, but you are going to have to turn details way down to achieve a decent frame rate. It also has a 2GB Radeon 540 dedicated graphics chip that helps run a bit better (about 50% more powerful than the integrated Intel chip) and both have no trouble driving my Dell 34 inch ultrawide monitor. The included 16GB of DDR4 RAM and SATA 3 256GB SSD are not upgradeable. Wireless performance is good and uses the Intel 8265 card. Bluetooth 4.1 works as expected.

Battery Life
Battery life is just ok. It has a decent sized 54Wh battery and gets about 6-8 hours of casual use with battery saver on. It's not quite as strong as competitors in the early stages of ownership, so I may need to dig into the power plan settings to see if I can make some tweaks. Since the device can charge over USB-C, a portable power bank is an option to help augment the battery. It is worth noting that the 54Wh battery is a bit on the small side when compared to other 15 inch machines, but it also does not have to drive a 4k screen.

Webcam
The front facing 720p webcam can best be describes as serviceable. It's fine for web conferences, but it's not going to win any awards. Windows Hello facial recognition is supported and works very well.

Heat & Fans
The device gets warm towards the middle back when under load, but the keyboard and touchpad are still comfortable to type on. If you are doing some heavy processing, it will get warm on your lap. The fans are not audible doing normal tasks, but do ramp up if playing a game or other processor intensive tasks. I was not able to detect any coil whine (the bane of every Dell laptop I have used).

OS/Bloatware
The device ships with Windows 10 Home and the Creator Update. There is quite a bit of bloatware installed including McAfee, Samsung Apps, and various Windows store games. The first thing I did was clear all of that stuff off. I would much rather have the Microsoft Signature edition install that you typically only get from the Microsoft Store and other vendors like Lenovo, but a little time doing app housekeeping or a fresh install resolves this. Samsung includes an app for driver updates, but it can also pull from the standard Windows 10 update process. For whatever reason, this newer Samsung Update app is not as good as previous versions as I constantly have to remind it what model of Samsung laptop I have. It also doesn't seem to indicate very well what drivers need updates versus what is already updated. I'd much rather they go back to the old version which was simpler to use and worked very well.","92","2"

I was going to make a crazy long review on why i picked a 15"" laptop over a 13"" and how it took me over a week of reading articles, watching youtube videos, and reading reviews from buyers. 
Then i was going to talk about how i can never make up my mind when spending money especially when its over $1000 and that i dragged around many sales associates for over 3 hours at bestbuy while i handled every single laptop in the building.

Now i will stop right there but now you have my backround

If you are researching the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro be aware that some articles and youtube are for the last model with 7th gen intel or the non Pro model, and they look very similar but can be very different.

Lets talk about the NP940X5N-01US that you are actually looking at on BestBuy

8th Gen i7 processor 8550
16gb Ram (this is DDR4 not DDR3 as listed on Bestbuy, bonus!)
256gb SSD
2gb DDR5 discrete video card
1080p LED screen (no 4k but 4k in a laptop doesnt make sense because drains your battery)
Backlit keys and adjustable how bright
Ports! 2x3.0 1xUSB-C Full HDMI, MicroSD

These are basic stats when comparing but note the error above, it could be important. (DDR4 installed)

Lets talk about other hidden features
There is no fingerprint scanner on this laptop but does have a IR facial recognition to work with Microsoft Hello. So if you need a finger scanner sorry, but if you like facial recognition like most phones use you are in luck, i am signed it before i can even reach for the keyboard... flawless.

This is also very thin, makes my old laptop look like a 1995 all over again, i handled many in store and i think it was the thinnest out of all the 15"" laptops, i could be wrong though

Ok lets go straight to what sets the Samsung Notebook Pro 9 apart from all other laptops. The S-PEN, there is NO OTHER laptop that offers a pen that mounts in the chassis. (should we call this a 3in1?) Its there wherever the laptop goes, never needs to be recharged, tips can be replaced. Samsung has mastered the pen and their screen because of Note phones and other devices that use it. 0.7mm Tip, tilt detection, and some rating of over 4000 for the pressure you use.

This laptop is beautiful, metal finish outside, with black interior to look good over the years. It does attract finger prints but can be wiped away.

The speakers are next to garbage, zero bass and not very loud. But they are very clear and if you have a Bluetooth surround system you will likely use that over a laptop anyway.

I have only had for a few days and keep finding out more features and tips for this. I have owned Samsung phones for years so it almost made sense to get a Samsung laptop and was lucky to catch this with $100 off. I should have waited to leave a review but with some misleading articles i wanted to set some things straight. If you have a question you can comment my review and i will try to help within a day.

Oh and also when you use 2in1 and flip it into tablet mode there is actually a magnet that helps snap it open when flipped.","6","0"

This is a touchscreen display.

OVERALL - I must say that so far, I am quite pleased with this laptop. I have only had it for a few days but I have been putting it through its paces to ensure it is worth keeping and will suite my needs. It is light for a 15"" laptop (yes it is 15"" and not 15.6"") and I think it hits a sweet spot on size. Big enough to work on papers and briefs and not strain my eyes. Form factor small enough to fit in my smaller backpack.

PERFORMANCE - I am coming from another popular brand 13"" 2-in-1 which was great for portability and media consumption but didn't have enough processing power for some of my professional needs. This Samsung does have the power needed. I have been able to simultaneously work on graphics intensive PowerPoints, Word documents, PDFs, and have multiple Chrome tabs open.

GRAPHICS / SCREEN - Radeon 540. You are not going to play AAA game titles on this, but if you like eSports, lower requirement Indie titles, or AAA games that are a few years older, you'll have a decent go at things. Media consumption is enjoyable. It is a 1080p screen that is quite bright. I usually prefer bright displays and this is decently bright at 75-80% in a lit room and 100% is just a torch. I will say that the included ""Samsung Setting"" software is a nice feature that provides the ability to change the color profile of the display and includes an HDR mode. Think twice before getting rid of this pre-installed software. 

BATTERY - Okay, the power meter is the one quirky thing I haven't figured out yet. When first unplugged, the battery will show only 3-4 hours of remaining time. After 10-20 minutes or so when running on battery the laptop will adjust the time and, depending on brightness and running programs, will reflect anywhere from 6 to upwards of 10 hours or remaining battery. I've used it for hours on battery and have gotten over 7 hours of use time.","3","2"

This laptop is light and size efficient, the weight about 2/3 of my previous one and it has 15"" screen while having smaller size comparing to my previous 13"" laptop. This one is also lighter and almost same size as the Inspiron 13"" version.

The built-in pencil is amazing and feels much better than the stylus pen. The battery is average, given the fact that the laptop is very light, it's natural to have a short battery life, but I believe the 8th i7 makes it better since it's more power efficient. By the way, the 8th i7 also makes this laptop superfast, it takes about 5 second to boost up, and maybe 1 second to recognize your face and log in to your account

The graphics card is just slightly better than the intel integrated one. I play hearthstone sometime (the touch screen is perfect) and you could see that the Radeon card is making the board looks fresh and colorful. But it is not a high performance card, so don't expect it could run best quality DOTA2 or Overwatch. 

The sound card is not the best, actually the first time I got my laptop, I noticed that everytime I left the computer on for more than 3 to 4 hours, the speakers would give me some squeezing noise, and this could only be cured by disable and re-enable the speaker. Then I toke the laptop to Bestbuy and got another one. The new one works perfect and that sound issue has not been observed.","13","0"

Pros: 
-The 2-1 on this laptop is superb. I owned a Surface Pro 4 and used the pen every day for note taking and I love the Samsung's version of that 10 fold. The stylus it comes with is slightly small but its convenient to have a place holder for when yours done. 
-The screen very well to the stylus and feels very natural to writing and drawing, even better than my previous Surface Pro. I love taking notes in OneNote with this thing!
-This laptop is fast, I had a lot of issues with the speed on the Surface pro's i5 processor but this i7 is TONS faster. Turns on in seconds, installs things fast, and has yet to blue screen on me or give me any issues when multitasking (surface did a number of times)
-The keyboard feels nice, I like how it lights up too.
-I like the port selection, especially the HDMI output. 
-I use this mostly inside, so I haven't had any issues with the screen brightness. The ""Out door"" mode does make it alot brighter
-I think my ULTIME enjoyment with this laptop is the battery life. I can get 8-10 hours EASY with just surfing the web, using OneNote, Word, etc. The battery on my surface SUCKED, had to carry my chagrer every where, so its so nice not having to anymore. 
- This this is light (in weight) for the power it has. I haven't games with it but I've watched reviews were people said the Radeon card can handle some light gaming. I'll try someday I'm sure. 
- It doesn't come with a ton of unnecessary programs on it that needs to be uninstalled. 

Cons:
-Speakers truly are my only con, and they are not that great, but luckaly I use headphones half the time anyhow

I would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for fast reliable machine that doesn't do heavy gaming or NEED theater sound out of the speakers.","1","0"

It was not perfect because when I first got it the Radeon card would jump from 100% usage to 0% with nothing running. A force shutdown reinstalling the card fixed it but the problem perused.

Setup/Testing/Conclusion

The Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US). Packed with an Intel i7 8750H, 16GB DDR4 2666 memory, 16GB Intel Optane Memory, and an Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. Let’s go ahead and dive right in and see how this Gaming Laptop performs.

Right off the bat, the Intel i7 8750H is an excellent CPU. You’re looking at the successor to the widely popular Intel i7 7700HQ which is what was used a lot in previous gaming laptops. With the Intel i7 8750H, you’re going to be getting about a 10% increase in single core performance and about a 15 ~ 25% increase in multi-core performance. The Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti isn’t the fastest nor is it considered a “high end” GPU, but it’s definitely considered as one of the best (if not the best) budget GPU. So before I even ran any games, my expectations weren’t going to be through the roof as I know it won’t perform like my desktop which contains an Intel i7-8700 and a GTX 1070. I mean we’re looking at a budget gaming rig here, not a top of the line gaming beast. So now that we got that out the way, let’s go ahead and see what this combo brings to the table.

CS:GO - 140 FPS
Tom Clancy’s The Division - 60 FPS
Battlefield 1 - 60 FPS
GTA V - 55 FPS
Diablo 3 - 95 FPS

As expected, this specific Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US) performs quite well. As mentioned previously, it’s not going to be the fastest out there; but it’s definitely not the slowest. So if you’re looking to play everything on ultra presets and expect incredible frames per second, I would probably invest in a pretty high end gaming rig. If you’re looking to play games on low/medium ~ high presets (Nvidia Recommended Settings), you’ll be just fine with this specific Lenovo Legion Y530. AAA titles will always demand a high performance machine. But with a gaming laptop, you’ll be able to bring it around with ease compared to a gaming desktop.

With the Legion Y530, I didn’t have a problem taking it around. Because of it’s subtle and sleek design, it doesn’t scream “GAMING”; yet it doesn’t look like an ordinary laptop. I personally enjoy the black design and look of the laptop. Although the Y530 is made majority of plastic, it's still quite durable and still looks good. Lenovo changed the backlit keyboard from red to white which looks a lot better. The bezels around the screen (left, top, and right) are also quite thin compared to the last years model. Because of the thin bezel change, the webcam was moved to below the screen. So if you plan on using the webcam, be prepared to show off your nose and in addition to the other party seeing your knuckles a lot if you're typing. But, I’ll definitely make that trade any day; smaller bezels vs having the camera at the top. If you currently own the last year’s model, you’ll also notice that a lot of the ports have been placed in the back of the laptop. You’ll still have access to a USB 3.1 port on either side of the laptop. The reason for this is so that it offers better cooling. Overall, the thermals on the Y530 is pretty good under normal usage. During my gaming session it does get warm but what gaming laptop doesn’t? I did see temps hit around 95c (MAX) but the fans would ramp up and keep the temps under control. The fans aren’t silent but they aren’t super loud either; I would classify the fan noise as expected/average. When it comes to the picture/screen quality, I wasn’t as impressed. I wished it was a bit brighter and the color reproduction was better. So if you were to use the Y530 in a more lit environment, you may have some difficulty viewing the screen. The 52.5Wh 3-cell lithium ion battery will last about 4 hours with general usage which is typically expected with these type of setups. But if you game on it, the battery will last about 1 ~ 1.5 hours. So be prepared to bring your charger with you! 

Here are a couple breakdown of pros and cons that I would like to mention as my own opinion:
Pros:

Very sleek at subtle design
No bloatware
Solid all around good performance
Fan control

Cons:
Display (not as bright as others and color reproduction isn’t as good)
Why GTX 1050 Ti? Would've liked to see at least a 1060 as Lenovo did an excellent job on the chassis. Lenovo also offers a 144Hz screen so it only makes sense to have a more powerful GPU… 
Wished battery lasted longer

In conclusion, this Lenovo Legion Y530 has pretty good all around performance. I didn’t experience any frame rate drops during gaming. My settings on average were around low/medium ~ high (Nvidia Presets/Recommended). I would’ve liked to see Lenovo release all Legion Y530 with a GTX 1060 and a SSD by default (as this specific model comes with a traditional mechanical hard drive and Intel Optane Memory). I know they have other models but from what I could find; GTX 1050 Ti is all they have currently. Overall, I would give this specific model a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. Lenovo did do an excellent job by ditching the red and making the Legion Y530 very sleek (excellent redesign Lenovo!). Where it falls short on this specific model is with the GTX 1050 Ti and the picture/screen quality. Although this specific model didn’t come with an SSD, the Intel Optane Memory did in fact help with boot/load times. This specific Lenovo Legion Y530 is definitely worth being stated as an excellent budget gaming laptop. If you’re able to get the one with an SSD, I’m sure it’ll be even faster. Overall, thoroughly impressed with the this Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0002US).

The Legion Y530 is a well-designed and performant laptop with quality and well-balanced components. The build is great, the thin-bezel display is awesome, the system is speedy, and it is a pleasure to use everyday. With its easy upgradeability, the Y530 will offer many years of service for most people.

======= Design & Build Quality =======

For a gaming laptop at this price point, the Legion Y530 is relatively light (~5 lbs) and pretty thin, even good for students and other portable users.

The laptop is all black and looks like a serious machine - no blingy accent lights with flamboyant design curves and lines. I appreciate the toned-down design and subtlety.

The parts of the laptop that you interact with the most feel nice despite being made of all plastic. The lid has a nice texture and radial pattern to it that makes the Legion look and feel different from other typical plastic laptops. Stains are easily resisted and cleaning up is simple and quick. The glowing white LED that illuminates the ""Y"" symbol inside the letter O is also very cool without being garish.

The hinge is well-designed and enables one to easily open the lid with just one finger. It is also firm & sturdy and holds up the screen very well. 

Also nice is the soft-touch keyboard base, the smooth touchpad, and the textured touchpad buttons. The keyboard buttons with their ""just-right"" travel distance and responsiveness lead to comfortable typing and gaming experiences. The keyboard has white LED backlighting with two different brightness levels (FN + Spacebar to toggle between Brightness Level 1, Level 2, and Off). I LOVE that the backlighting doesn't turn off automatically after some idle time (Acer take note~!). 

Despite lacking aluminum and not being ""premium"", I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 for design & build quality. 


======= Display =======

The 1920x1080 Full HD 15.6"" matte display, surrounded by those thin bezels, is quite nice. At normal viewing distance, everything is crispy and clear. For general-purpose web viewing and gaming, the display is perfectly adequate and appropriate. It doesn't get very bright at 250 nits but I'm satisfied.

I LOVE how I can lift the lid with just one finger and how the display can be pushed back up to 180 degrees.


======= Speakers =======

The speakers sound nice and full with its Harman Kardon speakers with Dolby Audio tuning. Compared to skinny ultrabooks, such as my HP Spectre 13, the Legion Y530's speakers sound louder, fuller, more dynamic, and has a wider soundstage. Bass, of course, is weak but that is to be expected from a laptop. Listening to music and playing games was more than satisfactory and enjoyable.


======= Network & Connectivity Options =======

The Legion Y530 comes equipped with the Realtek PCI Express Gigabit ethernet and the excellent Intel Wireless-AC 9560 802.11AC Gigabit Wifi. Also included in the Intel package is Bluetooth 5.0 which is forward-looking and up-to-date. I experienced no connectivity or connection speed issues. Everything was peachy. 


======= Ports =======

A healthy number and type of ports are offered - 3x USB 3.1 Type A, 1x USB Type C Gen 1, 1x ethernet, 1x HDMI, and 1x mini-Display port. The ports suit my needs perfectly and I have no complaints. For my personal usage, not having a Thunderbolt port is not a loss. 


======= Performance =======

The performance of the Legion Y530 is excellent due to its quality and well-balanced components (Intel Core i7 8th-Gen Coffee Lake CPU with 6 Cores, 16GB DDR4-2666 RAM, 1TB Seagate 7200RPM HDD, 16GB Intel Optane Memory, and nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB).

Windows 10 boots up relatively fast despite having a spinning HDD (thanks to Intel Optane Memory), programs install and load very quickly, and there is no jankiness or lag. It is AMAZING how much of a performance difference that stick of Intel Optane Memory makes in really speeding up the system and smoothing everything out.

Even when compared to my HP Spectre 13 with a faster 1TB Samsung 960 Evo PCI-E SSD, the Legion Y530 boots up almost as fast and loads my apps very quickly. Intel Optane is no marketing gimmick - it works as advertised and makes a very noticeable difference in system responsiveness and speed. Thanks to Intel Optane, I personally don't see a need to upgrade to a SSD drive - at least not for a while.

Wit 16GB of RAM, I naturally had no issues at multitasking - Google Chrome (~25 tabs), Word, YouTube, background file transfers and downloads. Only one scenario introduced a little bit of lag and that was when I was doing the following: Chrome brower with about 10 tabs, Steam client downloading 3 games in the background, and torrenting 3 files (each with about 5 GB in size). Still not bad for a system without a SSD drive.

Gaming is executed smoothly as long as you don't crank up all the in-game settings to Very High or Ultra (dependent on the game, of course). In order to experience the full potential of the Legion Y530, one has to be plugged in and change the Power Options to ""High Performance"" inside the Windows Mobility Center. Otherwise, games don't run very well, especially on just battery power. Besides, the battery would quickly run down to empty in about an hour anyways without the charger.

I mainly played 3 games on the Legion - Far Cry 5 (2018), Deus Ex Mankind Divided (2016), and Rise of the Tomb Raider (2016). The Rise of the Tomb Raider ran the best and allowed me to turn on most of the graphics settings to High and still average above 48 frames per second.

Deus Ex Mankind Divided was much harder on the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. In order to get smooth frames, I had to lower the quality settings quite a bit to this:

-Texture Quality: Low
-Texture Filtering: Off
-Shadow Quality: Medium
-Contact Hardening Shadows: Off
-Temporal Anti-Aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On
-Depth of Field: Off
-Bloom: Off
-Volumetric Lighting: Off
-Subsurface Scattering: Off
-Sharpen: On

Playing Far Cry 5 was a lot better and I was able to play smoothly with these settings:

-Texture Filtering: High
-Shadows: Normal
-Geometry & Vegetation: Normal
-Environment: Normal
-Water: Normal
-Terrain: Normal
-Volumetric Fog: Low
-Anti-aliasing: Off
-Motion Blur: On

On Geekbench 4.2.3, the Y530 scored 4664 Single-core and 15,197 Multi-core. It performed better than my Samsung Notebook 9 Pro with an Intel Core i7 7500U dual-core CPU (4189 Single-core, 8503 Multi-core) and my HP Spectre 13 with an Intel Core i7 8550U 4-core CPU (4666 Single-core, 12,051 Multi-core).

======= Keyboard & TouchPad =======

As mentioned earlier, both the keyboard and touchpad on the Legion Y530 are excellent. The keys have good travel distance, are responsive, and very comfortable for long-term typing and gaming. I also LOVE the full-sized Arrow Keys and the spacious Number Pad area. My only slight gripe is not having dedicated PgUp & PgDn buttons (you have to use the Fn + Arrow Keys).

The Touchpad is accurate and responsive to use thanks to Microsoft's Precision driver. Setting up custom touchpad gestures is easy and it works very well. The touchpad buttons make a clickity sound but not to the point of being annoying. 

I rate both of them 10 out of 10.


======= Battery Life =======

For a gaming laptop, the battery life I experienced has been excellent. When I'm just browsing the web and not gaming, I can get about 4 to 5 hours of battery life at 70 to 80% brightness. During gaming, however, it will last just about 1 hour. 


======= Software =======

The Legion Y530 comes with a minimal amout of bloatware. I counted 3 Lenovo apps, 5 third-party games, and some Microsoft apps such as Xbox and Skype. Compared to other manufacturers' bloatware (e.g., Dell, HP), the Legion Y530 comes packed pretty clean. Windows 10 was at version 1709 and I updated to the latest 1803 Build 17134.191 without a hitch.


======= Upgradeability =======

The Legion Y530 offers several options for future component upgrades - DDR4 memory, SATA3 hard drive (HDD or SSD), Wifi module, and PCI-Express NVME M.2 2280 SSD hard drive. To upgrade, one removes 11 Philips screws from the bottom of the laptop and pop off the bottom cover. The bottom cover is held on by numerous plastic tabs so be gentle when popping the cover off to not break them.


======= My Verdict =======

The Legion Y530 offers a good value, entry-level gaming experience with a great design, slim-bezel display, awesome keyboard and touchpad, great audio, and very decent hardware (6-core Intel Core i7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GPU). It is a well-balanced and harmonius design that is durable, portable, highly performant, and upgradeable. I rate it 4.5 out of 5 and recommend it without hesitation.","3","0"

- (Performance) This thing is a solid performer the GTX 1050 Ti does not throttle or lose performance and the wireless card is solid. It also has a feature in the software where you hold control+shift+1 and the fans boost to max speed. Overall performance is really solid the i7 8750h is solid processor and the GTX 1050 Ti graphics will allow you to play games like GTA V no problem maybe not on ultra but expect high settings on most games. The 16gb intel optane module available in the 16gb ram configuration definitely speeds up normal usage of the computer if you fill it up mostly with games expect more regular hard drive performance but it does definitely accelerate games, responsiveness, and boot up time
- (Cooling) This laptop has a metal grate on the bottom with two fans on the underside of the boxy part. They are definitely solid and cool the components well. The fans get loud but not too loud everything considered. The laptop does not output all that much heat. I used a Dell G7 for a short period of time and after playing a game it felt like I could heat food up by leaving it next to the back of the laptop NOT SO in this case. It has main intake on the bottom and vents are on the left and right sides of the back and smaller ones on the back of the left and right sides.
- (Keyboard) It's great! No RGB but depending on if you want this laptop for more than gaming it is a pro. Great travel, keys do not feel or look cheap and backlighting does not look cheap. Not a lot of tactile feedback but that is okay because travel is good. The arrow keys are huge however about as big as the left ctrl I do wish that that space could have been used for something else.
- (Speakers) The speakers sound very clear especially for this price range, they are nice and loud and positioned in the front of the laptop not on the keyboard deck or screen area but on the bottom portion facing forward. They lack a LITTLE bit of bass but still are overall very solid.
- (Design) No bezel makes this a compact laptop especially at such and affordable price. Overall it looks really good and cuts the footprint down. The tapered front, the offset screen, with the boxy back is a little different but you definitely get used to it and it is a good design. The hinge definitely looks good at first glance but I noticed the left and right sides start are bent inwards a little bit and are only connected to the main hinge only on one side. That said it stays in place where you leave it, it can bend to 180 degrees if that's important and does not wobble.The texture on the top of the laptop is definitely nice and the legion logo is pretty non obtrusive. Do be warned you cannot turn the light off. The soft touch material on the keyboard deck is also good it feels nice and seems like it will hold up. The laptop has very little flex to it except in the screen which still is not too bad. Power button is in a good position. There is a small minimal white pinhole light on the right side that turns on when the laptop is on and blinks when the computer is sleeping and another very similar one on the back behind the hinge right above the power port that turns orange when the laptop is charging and white when the laptop is fully charged. All of the ports on this laptop are on the back except for two USB 3 ports on the left and right sides and the headphone jack on the left side.
- (Trackpad) The trackpad good very precise just a little on the short and wide side. It would be nice if it was one continuous surface that could be clicked, but the buttons feel solid if not a LITTLE bit loud but still very tactile and very good.
- (Software) The Lenovo software is really good. Hotkeys for max fan and disable keyboard can be configured in Lenovo vantage. The default hotkey for max fan speed is HOLDING ctrl+shift+1. Dolby audio is included and that is good as well as a few other things overall. As with every laptop McAfee free trial -_- and a fairly useless Lenovo app explorer. Overall not a ton of bloatware and a fairly useful utility!

--- Cons ---

- (Display) The display is not very bright or vibrant so be aware of that. 250 nits means it works very so so outdoors and the colors definitely do not pop but it is still very clear and good enough for gaming and the 60hz refresh really does not matter with a 1050 Ti. Also, this is definitely a budget gaming computer so everything considered the display is a alright.
- (Battery) The battery life on this thing is about 4 - 4.5 hours or so when not gaming or doing anything intensive so be aware of that. About 1 - 1.5 hours or less when gaming so keep that in mind. Pretty standard however on a gaming laptop at this price point.
-(repairability) If you do intend to upgrade this laptop down the road be warned it is not an easy thing to do. this laptop has 11 screws and then you have to pry the clips open and it is easy on the front part of the laptop but somewhat nerve racking when you move towards the back so as not the break the clips. I do not know from personal experience but after looking through a couple of forums this is what I learned. I have heard you do not lose your warranty unless you damage the laptop while taking it apart.

- Conclusion -

This laptop is a budget gaming laptop do not expect it to compete with premium laptops such as the razor blade, the Alienware line, or any $1,500 or above gaming laptop. It does a number of this right but the screen is definitely so-so. That is fairly expected as no gaming laptop at this price offers a great screen. Definitely a solid laptop overall if performance is the only thing you care about the G7 is the better choice with a GTX 1060 max q which would give a 50% increase in performance at but definitely at the cost of portability and weight. This is a very compact laptop for the price, cooling, and hardware it offers. If you want a gaming laptop that is compact and a good value look no further. The design of this laptop alone aside from the plastic which is definitely still very good as there is little flex in it. Cooling is great and keyboard and trackpad are solid. Great laptop for a college student who also likes to game aside from the battery life. Overall a would recommend for someone who values portability, design, performance within reason, and price.","2","0"

The Lenovo Legion Y530 is a powerful laptop with a sleek design. This is my first gaming laptop, mostly because I had not found a good hybrid between gaming power and portability until now. I find it to be just thin and light enough to consider it portable, which is great because I am on the go quite often. Although color scheme is not a priority of mine, I like the subtle black exterior with a white illuminated keyboard and logo on the lid. Most of the ports are on the back of the laptop, the impressively effective cooling fans are underneath, and the power button is in the middle above the keyboard. Typing and using the various keys on the keyboard is easy thanks to the sufficient spacing and key size. My only complaint is that the touchpad feels a bit awkward to use due to the location, size, and left/right click buttons instead of a touchpad that clicks down, but that feeling has improved as I have gotten used to it. However, while at home, I prefer to use a mouse. Overall, I think the Lenovo Legion Y530 is a well-designed laptop. 

Features:
The speakers are good, but I have heard better quality sound on several other similar laptops. If you usually use headphones, this may not matter much, but I was expecting better sound quality, especially since it is highlighted as a feature of this Lenovo Legion Y530. The HD webcam is very clear, so I have no complaints there. Since this is a gaming laptop, there is plenty of memory, a powerful processor, and great graphics on a beautiful display. Even standard use, such as browsing the internet or watching videos, is enjoyable due to the speed and quality of the content displayed on the screen. 

Gaming:
With great graphics and lots of processing power, gaming sessions on this laptop are fantastic. I have experienced nothing but smooth gameplay, and I am impressed by the graphics on all the games that I have played. Connecting to Wi-Fi was a breeze, and the connection has always remained stable and fast during online gameplay. As a longtime gamer, I am impressed and would definitely recommend this laptop to fellow gamers. 

Verdict:
The Lenovo Legion Y530 is the perfect blend of power and portability for gaming and everyday use. As opposed to other gaming laptops with flashy designs and colors, I like the subtlety and sleekness of this laptop. Processing power is not compromised due to the compact design, and my gaming sessions have not disappointed. Although it is not perfect in every way, if you are looking for a gaming laptop that is also great for everyday use, then look no further. I recommend the Lenovo Legion Y530 to others with confidence.","1","0"
"126","Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black","Great entry level, budget gaming laptop","PlainSight","5","I bought the Legion Y530 with the i7-8750H, 16GB, 128GB + 1TB HDD, 1050TI. I tested out a lot of different gaming laptops before settling on this one due to the price, aesthetics, warranty, and ability to run all the modern games I play at 60fps. The laptop doesn't have some features more expensive gaming laptops have such as multi-colored keyboard lighting, 120hz display, Thunderbolt 3. But it more than makes up for it with its sleek, slim design, beautiful display, thin bezels only more expensive laptops have, and a 1050TI that is still more than capable in 1080p gaming. I really loved how solid this laptop felt in my hands too, it really feels like it could take a fall with many scruffs and still run. The MSI GS65 I tried was a bit too fragile in the hands in my opinion. I purchased an extended on-site warranty and accidental damage plan for peace of mind too. The keyboard also feels very solid, it has a nice depth to it and is satisfying to press down on.

I enjoyed the 2 USB ports on the side of the laptop for a wireless receiver and USB drive. Most other ports are in the back for nice cable management. My gaming desk looks good when I'm not portable - no hanging wires on the side, rather out of sight in the back.

The battery will last you about 3-4 hours off the charge realistically. This is enough for my needs but is something to consider if you are frequently without an outlet nearby. You will always want to game with the laptop plugged in for maximum performance, I do not enjoy gaming without the battery plugged in for any gaming laptops.

After very light tweaking, I haven't run into any heat issues so far. The i7-8750H do run hot in these slim laptops in general, so be sure to read forums and do your own proper research to understand more about it. I get under 89C for the CPU during gaming, GPU always under 70C. Very acceptable to me. With Lenovo Vantage software you can press Control + Shift + 1 to turn on the Cooler Boost to help with cooling too. I would like to see Lenovo come out with more detailed fan control and the ability to control the Turbo Cooler Boost to your liking.

I am able to run most of my games at or around 60fps on high and medium settings, never low. The games I play are Sea of Thieves, Battlefield 4/1, Call of Duty BO4, PUBG, Overwatch, WoW, Skyrim, CSGO, Rainbow 6 Siege and other indie and older games that run it with ease.","1","0"
"127","Lenovo - Legion Y530 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 1TB Hard Drive - Black","A Lot To Like","jailoliv","5","Pros
. Intel Optane with 32GB
. Nice backlit full key keyboard
. Great dual cooling system
. 6-core i7 8th generation
. Gtx 1050ti graphics card
. Great touchpad
. 1TB drive 
Cons
. Camera is on the bottom of the screen
. HDD instead of SDD 

With a 16GB RAM, instead of the 8GB model, there is a lot to like about this Lenovo Legion Y530. The design is excellent: relatively light and thin for a gaming laptop, a great touch pad and a nice back-lit full key keyboard although you can’t change the color of the light.

Because it uses an Intel i7 CPU and a GTX 1050ti GPU it does get hot but it has a great dual cooling system that can be adjusted via software. For everyday tasks, the battery lasts a little over 4 hours but I do not recommend to run games on batteries. In my experience, I had to connect it to power in about an hour after playing Battlefield but that is expected with a powerful laptop like this one. It does video editing well too but the battery charge won’t last for very long either. Again, this is expected and is the price you pay for such power. 

I noted a considerable difference in performance between this and the 8MB model in both gaming and video editing. And apparently, I had a few more minutes of battery time as well. My guess is that it is due to the extra RAM and the Intel Octane.

Good IPS display. The plastic body doesn’t feel cheap. The speakers are above average. 802.11ac WiFi performs very well and it also comes with Ethernet, USB 3 and type C ports as well as HDMI and mini DP.

It uses a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) instead of a Solid State Drive (SSD) but the built-in Intel Octane 32GB makes its performance somewhat similar to an SSD. Although my preference is for 32GB, 16 GB of RAM is a fairly good amount for most applications. Lastly, the camera is on the bottom, not the top of the screen. Not an issue for many people and not a deal breaker for me but it is not my preferred place for a camera. 

Overall, it is a great gaming laptop for gaming and for not-too-complex video editing. Unless you are a hard core gamer willing to spend at least twice as much, you can’t go wrong with this laptop. Highly recommended.","2","1"

-NO RED. For whatever reason most companies who make gaming laptops think everyone wants red all over the keyboard and laptop. This is a clean white touch.
-Amazing screen. Picture quality is incredibly sharp.
-Price point. Right around $1000 for these specifications is ideal.
-Plug in's are on the back of the laptop. It's frustrating when power, Ethernet, USB, etc plug ins are on the side. This one moves it to the back.

Areas I wish were better:

-There's a separate left and right click button on the track pad. Wish I could just click the track pad, but you get used to it.
-Weight. It's slightly heavy here at about 4 lbs. Not the worst but it's noticeable.
-Number pad is in a slightly odd place. I dont use this too much but if you do it's something to keep in mind.

Overall, It's great for the price. If you want a nice laptop that can play games without breaking the bank, this is the one for you.","12","2"

While great for the majority of games on the market and for video editing it is marginal at best for virtual reality applications at this time.
It has a very nice textured finish on the ABS plastic chassis, good cooling, reasonable battery run time and has small bezels around the screen with the camera placed on the bottom. The small bezels allow for a smaller footprint and a better visual experiance. At a hair over five pounds it is portable and can also be used as a business computer/number cruncher. It is a great improvement over computers with less RAM and standard hard disk drives.","1","0"

"132","Dell - G7 15.6"" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 128GB Solid State Drive + 1TB Hard Drive - Licorice Black","HUGE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK","branberrycakes","5","This has to be the best gaming laptop for the price in a while and even rivals those that cost 2x the price. First off, I got this laptop on sale during Memorial Day week at $1,040.99. I was looking for a laptop specifically with the GTX 1060 GPU and behold, Dell knocks it out of the park with this bad boy.

== PROs ==
-1060 6GB VRAM Max Q Design is an absolute beast. Played games like DOOM (2016), Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Gears of War 4, The Division ALL on Ultra Settings. I was averaging 60-95 Frames Per Second during massive action scenes! Mind you, I played each game at least 2 hours straight and the laptop kept cool between 69-71 Celsius! So, short answer is yes, this thing can tackle gaming at 1080p 60fps no problem. I haven't tried gaming at 4K 30FPS, but based on benchmarks provided via YouTube, as long as the game is well optimized, you should be able to play at 4K at playable frame rates on Medium settings which is also amazing.

-Overclocking the refresh rate (AUO63ED Panels ONLY). I was lucky enough to get one of these panels. Unfortunately, I cannot find any information on how to determine this unless you verify internally. Anyhow, I was able to overclock up to 96Hz without any issues. You can go up to 100Hz, but I haven't been able to try it out myself just yet. Either way, playing at frame rates higher than 60FPS is a beautiful thing to see.

-Thunderbolt 3 port for future eGPU (External Graphics Card) is awesome once the 1060 starts to age, but should be able to play games very well until the next 3-4 years depending on how resource intensive video games get. I wouldn't be surprised though if this card defeats the next iteration of both Sony's and Microsoft's consoles.

-128SSD+1TB HDD 5400 RPM, really great how they added an SSD and 1TB of hard drive space compared to the other version of this laptop

-16GB of DDR4 RAM, once again, amazing that they were able to give this at this price range

-Build design, the black chassis and the blue accent looks great. The laptop itself is about 5lbs so it's got some decent weight, but not your typical heavy gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Helios 300. It's pretty thin but not macbook air thin. This is a great gaming laptop without looking like one which is a HUGE plus to me.

-The Screen itself is a 1080p IPS Panel. Looks great, but you could tell that they had to make some compromises to keep budget friendly. Although this can be taken as a con, I'm not. It doesn't have the best representation of colors, but like I said, it gets the job done and games look good on it.

== CONS ==

-Wish the bezels on the screen were smaller, but its not bothersome nor will it drive you insane unless you are very picky 

-Speakers aren't that great, but yet again I play primarily with headphones so it doesn't really affect me as a buyer. It's decent, but won't blow you away for sure.


As you can see, the PROs definitely outweigh the CONs. I couldn't be happier and it's great that gaming laptops are getting more powerful, thinner and most of all, being more budget friendly.","22","0"

It only gets loud under load, it only gets hot under load. and it has a ton of power. An i7 8750h and 1060 Max-Q is all you need to run modern games at high settings.

Pros
- Perfect balance of weight and durability. I feel confident holding this laptop (6 pounds)
- 15.6 inches is great for portability
- It's much quieter compared to other gaming laptops
- Very smooth display! (Hopefully you get lucky and acquire the AUO63ED panel like I did, which is overclock-able to ~90-100hz!)
- Keyboard lighting is blue!!!
- USB ports are fast, and there's a thunderbolt 3 that supports 4 lane-PCIE
- Touchpad is smooth and accurate
- Keyboard has a full numpad
- The front of it has nice blue accented cooling pipes inside
- Easy access to interior parts with just one screw! (Holy moly, other manufacturers, pay attention!)
- 128gb SSD boots up Windows fast, just make sure you download all other things to the hard drive.
- The i7 8750h is a monster CPU. This thing can handle so many tasks at once it's ridiculous. I was downloading 3 games on 3 different platforms and able to play Rocket League smoothly at the same time.

Cons
- Big bezels for the display
- Display isn't very color accurate
- Backlighting for keys is very low, and there's only 3 settings for them
- I had to make sure the 1060 Max-Q was being used in most applications that don't specify otherwise. (The laptop tried using the integrated graphics)
- There is no num-lock lighting indication (there's one for caps lock)
- Arrow keys are squeezed together and small

I was being very nit-picky for the cons. This laptop is amazing! If you need power for tasks, games on the side, and are on a budget of ~$1,200 then you need to buy this!","25","4"

The keyboard and general sluggishness of MacOS ruled out any computers from Apple. I look at the Surface Book 2 (owned a Surface Pro 4 for a while and loved it) but the price kept me away. I purchased an HP Spectre x360 but constant fan noise and horrible trackpad kept me hunting. I saw the low-key announcement for Dell's G-Series gaming laptops and was intrigued. When I saw it on sale Memorial Day weekend, I couldn't resist. For the price, this is an amazing value. 

Pros
+ Amazing performance
+ RAM and both disk drives are user-upgradable
+ Number keys on keyboard
+ Ports!!! 3 USB A, 1 USB C, and HDMI
+ Windows Precision Drivers for trackpad
+ Matte screen (little glare in sunlight/bright lights)

Cons
- Screen quality isn't as good as compared to Macbook, Surface, etc. It's not bad in my opinion but is definitely lower grade than some competitors. 
- Bezels (really Dell? really?)
- Occasionally the fans will get really loud. I think it's McAfee or some other program staring in the background. The noise only lasts for 30 seconds or so. Not a big deal but occasionally annoying.
- Weight. Coming from a 13"" Macbook Pro, this weighs over 2 pounds more. It's noticeable if your coming from a smaller laptop.

I've played a few games (definitely be plugged in when gaming!) and am impressed with the GTX 1060. I have a GTX 1070 in my desktop so I have a comparison data point. Getting 70+ fps in Subnautica. Haven't tried my Oculus Rift yet but it should handle it without issue. 

If you're looking for a high-performance machine for a great price, get this. Sure you can get a better laptop but you'll pay for it. The comparable Alienware is several hundred dollars (based on when I compared prices mid-May) and doesn't seem to have any benefit other than a slightly better screen and an alien logo. If you're on the fence, go for it. You'll be happy.","5","0"

I've been trying to figure out a good way to still play all the new games I want. I thought about getting a Switch, but the third-party support for that isn't all that impressive and the screen in portable mode is 6"" which might be ok, but thinking about games like Diablo or Borderlands on a screen the same size as my infotainment system in my car sounded like it could be rough. I was originally thinking I would just give it up, but then I read some other articles and sites that convinced me that a gaming laptop might be exactly what I need, and it is!

Reviews have talked about how heavy the laptop is and how dim the screen is, but I'm mainly hooking the laptop to a TV and playing with an XBOX controller, so neither of those are concerns for me! I was frustrated at first because I tried running a game on it and it ran terribly, but it turns out the reason was because it was still trying to use the onboard graphics instead of the dedicated graphics card. I read an article that explained how to select what adapter is used for gaming in Windows 10, and once making that change, I was quite happy!

I only have 2 gripes, but they're both to be expected by not buying one of the higher end laptops:

1) I benchmarked WWE 2K19 and was getting between 45-55 FPS. Still playable, but there was noticeable lag. Side note: Benchmark means push the system as hard as possible and see how it does. In this case, it was a 6 man tag match with all graphics settings set to max. Fortunately, in my actual playing, there's never any lag, and about the only difference is that I only have maybe 4 people on screen at once. 

2) The screen is only 1080P. I was thinking it'd be cool to have 4K so I can see if I really want to invest in it for my TV.. Side note: Keep in mind what you're playing your laptop on if you connect it to a TV like I usually do. I had the game settings maxed out but this is in my office with a 720P TV, so there's no sense in using maxed out settings. When playing on the laptop itself though, then I do all maxed out.","1","0"

There is just so much this laptop offers. It is SUPER appealing to the eyes, very sleek lines, great black and ice blue color scheme, G7 chrome labeling. It feels very well made and solid. The game play is exceptional, colors on screen are vivid and bright, sound is clear and crisp, game play is smooth without any drops or latency.

Dell seriously outdid themselves building this machine. It offers everything I have been looking for in a gaming laptop for years. Everything combined, this is an exceptional deal on a very well made laptop.

I also use this for home & work tasks. It performs superbly. I can even have several programs, web windows open at the same time as game play and there is no drag. It powers through like butter.","16","1"

While it's a great value, be careful if you're planning on upgrading the RAM and SSD. I spoke to DELL tech support (which by the way hung up on me after they could not solve my problem) and read a lot of comments online, this model is not compatible with most memory cards with performance. The only RAM compatible with this model is DELL which costs a ton of money and Crucial which is out of stock. Also for the SSD or if you're trying to add an SSD into an empty slot, you will have major problems booting up the laptop and it will get stuck on DELL logo when booting up after SSD install.

The only draw backs so far (5 weeks give or take) is the battery life and getting an occasional horizontal screen tare consisting of the black and green etch. I am on the laptop for school about 7-8+hrs a day and notice it maybe once every other day. Overall it has been everything that I hoped for and especially happy with the fact that I paid nearly $1000 less than its big name competitor.

Because it usually takes more than 15 days for that piece in the display assembly to ""drop down"" you will only notice it after Best Buy's short return window is passed and you'll be stuck dealing with Lenovo's customer service.

Great balance of work-capable (primary use) and occasional gaming (Nvidia 1050). The keyboard has a great feel and responsiveness and then there's the incredibly clear, vibrant 4K screen. Now the bad. After 4 months of use, the screen has developed a horizontal black bar at the top right. I checked the Lenovo community and found 60 pages of this problem. I called Lenovo support for service and the rep didn't (or couldn't/wouldn't) acknowledge that this was a known problem with a proper fix. I have to bring it to Best Buy where they will repair or replace. Based on the 60 pages of this problem, the repair and replace don't fix it. Within a few months the problem arises on about 90% of those who either had the unit repaired or replaced with same. It is not a hardware issue and does not project to a second monitor. I don't know whether to be more upset about the issue or the failure of Lenovo to acknowledge this quality control, design or production issue. If the evidence showed that repair worked or the newer production runs did not have this problem then I would rate it higher. Very frustrating.","1","0"

Well, it's day two of owning this machine and the top right-hand corner of the screen is showing a black line. This is UNACCEPTABLE for a $1,500 laptop. I will be returning this unit immediately. The unit's speed is impressive due to the quad core i7 processor, 16 GB of ram, and a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU. However, the screen issue renders the impressive specs meaningless. Be cautious purchasing this unit until Lenovo fixes the issue. Unfortunately, there aren't many other quad core 2 in 1 options on the market in this price point.","1","0"

It was tough because there are so many choices and I really had to do the research. This computer came out on top each and every time. The only point that I can say that makes this computer lose a little and this is personal preference is the size/weight. It's not easy to hold in tablet mode unless you have a beefed up arm muscles. It is doable but not super practical. I wanted the bigger screen and beefer computer power so it comes at a price. If you want portability, surface would have been my second choice followed by the HP Spectre. I just wanted more bang for my buck and what you get in this laptop verse the others, just wins. If you don't need the extra boom and stuff...the price still wins.

I was on the phone for over an hour, talked with three different agents, and was disconnected all three times when it came time to resolve my issue with a return of the the laptop.

I will take the laptop to my nearest Best Buy today and return it. It is a 45 mile drive, so I am not pleased.

I paid extra for the Geek Squad certification. The box had the stickers on it, but it is obvious that the laptop was not checked out. Sending a non-working unit out as a certified unit is very shabby. In addition, the customer service that was provided was horrendous, as the call was dropped three times during an hour of calls, with no resolution,

The touch screen is a nice addition although I don't have much use for it.

So far it's been a couple of months and the laptop is still performing great and has had a lot of editing use.

Around two weeks ago, Lenovo technicians found this problem is caused by the LCD cover and uppercase, they decided to change it. Unfortunately, these parts are not available at that time. I need to wait around one week. Now two weeks have passed since Lenovo received my laptop (August 24th). They still have not fixed my laptop.

1- College- This computer has an excellent screen, its bright and very colorful/clear. Its also very capable machine. I can run blackboard for my classes, split the screen with Microsoft Word or excel and it wont skip a beat. 

2- Business Operations- I run Quickbooks, my own custom CRM as well as building websites. Again the screen is very important to me since i was coming from a macbook and they usually have excellent screens. 

3 Photoshop, lightroom and adobe CC- The GTX makes this computer a solid performer for editing pictures and videos. Also the SSD is super fast. Its not quite as fast as the apple SSD but i was able to transfer 40GB data from an external HDD to my computer and, it took only about 8-9 mins! 

4 Light Gaming- I am not a professional gamer but i do enjoy playing games and this is where the computer shines. I had a macbook pro late 2016 with touch bar. The macbook was about 300 dollars more expensive and i can say it was half capable of what this machine is. I can play GTX V, Cities XXL, BattleField 4/1. They all play very smooth on 1080p setting high or medium and on this screen looks amazing!

My over all satisfaction is very high coming from apple. Windows has come a long way. Eventho this machine is not constructed as an apple product its really solid! I love love the screen. To me a powerful machine without a good screen is just not worth it. Again keyboard is good, screen is amazing, the specs on this computer is excellent for a 2-1 and, build quality is very solid. So far i haven't had any issues, driver problems or anything like that. 

If you're looking for a solid machine that has a mix of blood between a 2-1 and a gaming machine? Wait no longer this is the perfect mix!","1","0"

For the past few weeks I've been using it for photoshop, but I also tested it with Avid video editing with 4k video and Davinci Resolve for video color correction. The processors are noticeably faster than the HP Spectre x360 - which is a similar price and a good computer in its own right. Using it as a drawing tablet with Photoshop, I can say that this and all other 2 in one laptops probably have a similar problem - as a tablet, it's missing the quick access keys that you would expect from a wacom tablet, so there is a bit more fussing to open unfold the computer to get to the keyboard to do some commands. And if you have the keyboard open, then, the keyboard gets in the way of your drawing. So it's not ideal, but having a wacom tablet with all the wires and plugs and other stuff is not ideal either. So I'm going to keep both. The power button on this particular laptop is located on the side and isn't recessed, so if you are the kind of person you likes to change their grip often and in odd ways in order to get into your drawing, you will probably hit it and accidentally put your computer to sleep. It only takes two seconds to wake up, butit's still a nussance, but fortantely Windows 10 allows you to turn off that button, so it only works to turn the computer on and then you hit the windows icon>shut down to turn it off. This makes life really convenient. But the quick compariison for this computer versus the spectre is the audio sounds better on this computer, the processing power is much greater on this one, but the battery life is much longer on the spectre. (and the spectre is prettier)","1","0"

The 4K display on the Yoga 720 is beautiful, and this is the first touchscreen I have used that reliably registers my touch. Build quality seems solid. 
Note to those considering other convertibles - when you fold the Yoga into tablet configuration, the keyboard is automatically disabled to prevent errant key activations from below. This is of course how it should be. But HP doesn't seem to know this, as the keyboard on some of the HP convertibles at Best Buy remained active in tablet mode leading to stray key presses. 
I wish the Yoga 720 had a few more ports onboard (Ethernet, display), but I knew about that when I purchased. Lenovo seems to be going the same direction as others in this regard, forcing you to buy and carry external dongles if you want those other ports. At least this laptop is Thunderbolt 3 compliant (2 channel), so additional ports can be added at full speed (vs adding a combo port expander on USB3.1 non-thunderbolt, which may have to reduce the speed of each to fit everything in the lower bandwidth of USB3.1 vs thunderbolt). Also note that the Yoga has a separate charging port, so it doesn't have the problem found in Apple and other devices that charge through the USB3.1 port, where you can use a USB3.1 dongle OR charge your computer.
These are all little things that aren't obvious until you start looking at the details, and comparing to other options. In my opinion, Lenovo got it all right with this one.","1","0"

They inaccurately claimed the display issues were no longer an issue if manufactured after a certain date. 

What happens you ask? A black horizontal line starts to fall from the top of the display. Mine is only falling on the right hand side but still draws my attention constantly - especially every time I go to close a window. 

If you buy this and get stuck with the malfunction happening outside your return window it takes 1-3 weeks for a repair. You can take it to the Geek squad for repair but they probably can't actually fix it for you there (despite Lenovo support indicating they can.) They will likely have to send it out to their service center. Do not get for school work or anything else unless you can afford to be without a laptop for 1-3 weeks. 

Additionally, the touch screen randomly stops working. I bought the Bamboo Ink Pen to use with it and some think the issue might be related. Best Buy will recommend you buy this $70 pen but I promise you will regret it if your laptop is anything like the 2 I have had so far.

At this point, I will likely stop taking my business to Best Buy and am doubtful I will ever buy another Lenovo product. Please be careful and don't be lured in by what appears to be an excellent price point!","1","0"

The Lenovo Yoga 720 15"" UHD. I had the black line issue just like everyone else on my laptop's screen which appeared after 2 months so I couldn't return it to Best Buy. So my only option was to get my laptop fixed under warranty. Lenovo did ""fix the black line"" (they didn't even tell me what part they replaced) and sent the laptop back to me. Now, a couple of months later, my laptop is again having issues with the screen. The screen constantly flickers and glitches. I have now contacted Lenovo again asking for an exchange since this laptop was obviously a piece of junk and they denied this request saying that they could only ""repair the laptop"". They did offer on-site repair rather than depot send-in but it has now been a week and I was told that a technician would be at my house to fix my laptop in THREE DAYS. After calling for the third time, they told us that it would be three days once they received the parts to repair it. This is an issue because I have to go to college in a week and although they ""expedited"" the repair parts, they don't seem to be coming any faster.

Since first use, I've had problems with the track pad. I can't get the cursor to move, and it won't let me click to open new web browsers. When it finally does open a program or web browser, it acts like I'm holding down the backspace key - and I get loads of \\\\\\\ in my web address box or my document. Sometimes I can't stop it, so it just keeps going. It happens when I use it after it's been in sleep state. 

I selected this laptop based on the recommendations of a Best Buy sales person. I need it for my home recording studio, and also for editing video. I'm afraid that it's not going to be enough laptop for what I need. I was told the RAM was expandable, but it isn't. And with the way my trackpad and browsers are freezing up when I open them, I can't imagine trying to run a DAW flawlessly. Lastly, I have a 10 year old Lenovo and the sound quality out of that far surpasses this. I've compared them side by side using my studio headphones and the sound quality and tonal range are much better than the Yoga 720. For the time being, I'm going to use the old one to listen to new mixes until I figure out what to do. 

Overall, I was really excited to buy this laptop. It was a really big purchase for me and after my convo with the sales person, I felt confident it would meet my needs. But now I'm just sad and stuck with something that I don't think will work for me. :(","1","0"

I work a little with Autocad and Inventor, various control systems programs, and some graphical design programs. I usually have multiple of these apps open at a time, while having a excel and word open, and a dozen tabs in Chrome. It hasn't skipped a beat. 

It's surprisingly lightweight for the specs. The screen is great (colorful and bright), the keyboard works well enough (I'm not super picky about keyboards, as long as they're not noisy), the battery will last 4-5 hours of continuous use. While there are only 2 USB A 3.0 ports and 1 USB C 3.1, these are fine for me. If I need more, I'll buy a USB hub. The speakers are the best in a laptop that I've owned (plenty of bass, plenty of volume).

The only real complaint I have is software related; plenty of apps don't play well with the 4k screen. Popup boxes will be tiny and cramped, icons are beyond tiny, text is almost illegible. I can play around with screen and magnifier settings to get everything good enough in a certain app, but this sometimes leaves other apps too large or jumbled. It's a constant chore with certain apps that I use frequently. 

If I had a choice to buy again, I would choose the 1080p screen in the same configuration. Otherwise, this is a great laptop.","2","1"

1. send it back to their facility(via mail) / 2. take it to bestbuy 's ""depot""? - w/ warranty info printed out. both of these take god knows how much waiting time... 

known issue : (please refer to the link below.) https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/ll06_en/thread-id/53066/page/49

Seems like the issue is with the 4k version only. 
Bought brand new back in end of august, 
*note* you only get in-house service IF you buy the extended / upgraded warranty from lenovo. 

I'm furious that $1300 laptop is giving this kind of issue. I'm a college student who has virtual machine and other licensed software installed on the machine. so sending this back is impractical. 
and bestbuy doesn't want to even talk to me for not buying a geeksquad subscription. will stick to buying from Micro Center as they are willing to work with you more even out of ""14 day period"".","10","2"
"239","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Quad Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum Silver","Great all-in-one laptop","vamsi","4","I was looking for a laptop with good configuration: i7 processor, minimum of 12GB RAM, NVIDIA Graphics, 4K UHD touch screen,.... ; and this was the only one out there with all those features loaded in it. 

Keeping aside the high capacity crusial hardware (like the i7-7700 processor, 16GM RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1050 2GM Graphic Card, and 512GB SSD), the design is very classy and slim. The keypad is very sturdy, as opposed to the ones on Ideapad models. It also boasts a fingerprint reader which is pretty cool. The HD 720p camera is just fine.

Unfortunately, 'Silver' is the only color option Lenovo has in this model. The touch screen is okay, but I observed a little bit of hang and response lag a couple of times. Although the audio is fine, the speakers' location is a bit creepy. They are located right below the laptop, a bit close to the edges. As a result, it won't give you the sound output completely.

I thought I'd get the Lenovo stylus along with the laptop. But to my surprise, when I unboxed the product, there wasn't any stylus in the stylus pack (it was empty). I don't know why there isn't any stylus, even though there is an assigned stylus pack in the box.

Pros:
* Design
* Value for money
* 4K UHD screen
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2GB Graphics

Cons:
* Speakers
* No color options
* No stylus in the box
* A bit expensive (but reasonable for the features)","1","0"

I use mostly for web, videos, and running VMs for development. With 16GB ram, 4K (hard to read without scaling it so it's a bit too much!), touchscreen, fingerprint, and SSD this laptop seemed to fit me well and won't be a slug in two years. Can't think of another laptop I've seen with this combo anywhere close to the memorial day sale price of one thousand, and as of writing it's over two hundred more and still a decent deal.
The downside is it's a bit bulky given the screen size and the battery life isn't very long. I normally leave it plugged at home anyway. Also windows 10 home is frustrating, but at least the ssd helps boot and wake up times. 
I heard on other reviews sites and forums that a few yoga 720 owners would eventually see a black strip at the top of their screens losing the top few rows of pixels. So far a couple of months and all is good, so maybe it was just a QC issue in earlier batches.","1","0"

I had to return the first unit because a visible (and very distracting) horizontal line appeared across the top right corner of the screen after a couple of weeks of use. The replacement unit seemed to be fine only for the exact same issue to affect it shortly after my return/exchange period expired. Very very dissappointed!!

I had read about the issue with the screen developing a black line that falls into the viewing area at the top, but decided to risk it anyway and hope for the best. After 4 days the black line appeared at the top of the page and I was devastated! I really liked this computer! It was flawless in all other ways but after reading more reviews I decided it just wasn't worth exchanging for the same model. This is an ongoing issue with 67 PAGES of complaints and comments regarding this models issue on the Lenovo websites support page. The only reason for the ONE star is because they know the issue exists but fail to recall the remaining computers and fix or replace the screens. Shame on you Lenovo! :(","11","0"

"483","Lenovo - 14"" Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Mineral Gray","Nice but just a tad slow browsing speed","TimTime","4","Thought I'd give a run down on this laptop after having it a week. I paid $149 for this while it was on sale. For $149 it is a decent deal. I don't think I'd spend $199 for it and definitely wouldn't buy it at it's normal price of $249. I like the build quality a lot. Even though it's plastic it is very strong and durable and feels very good in the hand. Fairly light but yet strong. No fingerprint problems. The cover is nice and smooth. The display is just ok. Not bad but it is a TN panel so the viewing angles are not going to be great. For browsing or working on documents it is fine. For watching movies the blacks are going to look bad and washed out. If you are use to an IPS screen you probably won't like it. But we are talking $149 here.

Speed. I find the speed is fine except for browsing. Runs MS Office just fine. It even runs Microsoft flight Simulator 2004 fine (13 year old game and running it from the SD card getting 50+ frame rates). For todays games it might not be so good. For browsing it runs Edge OK, but Firefox and Chrome are slow. Comparing this to my Acer Chromebook 14 and my Chromebook is a speed demon compared to this Lenovo. Its ok for light browsing but you can really tell it is only 2gb of ram as it really needs 4. 

Just to clarify, this runs a 64bit version of Windows 10, not 32bit. And that's unfortunate because it would run better on 32bit and you would get another 5-6 gb of space if it did. Alas there are no 32bit drivers for touchpad and other hardware, believe me because I tried installing 32 bit on it. Here's whats funny. I have a 2 year old AcerX205ta 32bit WIn10 and with the same software installed, the Acer has 12gb left compared to this Lenovo which has 5gb left. So you are stuck with 64bit.

Pros: Form factor, build quality, keyboard. Can live with the display. Price. Speed ok for some games and Office. AC wifi. USB-C and USB 3.0 ports. Micro SD slot. Battery life 8+hours. Light enough for travel.

Cons: Browsing speed. RAM. HD space. Display for movies.","30","2"
"484","Lenovo - 14"" Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Mineral Gray","Excellent PC for its purpose (ultra budget)","Todd","5","Look, if I were to review this computer against NORMAL computers, the Lenovo ideapad 120S would get a 1 star. But this PC is not intended to compete against those computers, they are in completely different categories. Reviewing this PC for its INTENDED PURPOSE, that being a super budget PC that competes with the plethora of Google Chromebooks, this computer definitely deserves a 5 out of 5. The keyboard is probably the best feature. It is one of the best I've used...very responsive. No backlit keyboard, oh well. Webcam is there (its OK, nothing special). HDMI port, USB 3.0, extra USB port, USB C, fullsize HDMI, microSD slot, and indicator LED for power and HD (left side). The bezzel of the screen has plenty of space for Neonode AirBar (sold by Best Buy) which can add touch capabilities. And what is very nice is that out of the box the bloatware is very limited, just McAfee and a couple Lenovo Apps.

The only real downside of this computer is the 32GB of storage and the 1.1 GHz dual core Celeron processor. Look, Windows is snappy and boot time is about 25 seconds. It is good enough for what it is. The 32GB drive is pretty is ""eh"" considering the space. I wish it was 64GB, but it will do. Out of the box there is like 12GB free. After installing Office 2016 and installing updates (the computer runs Windows 10 Home v1703), you get down to around 7.5GB free. It is tight. I recommend downloading the latest Windows 10 ISO, v1709 creators update, creating USB installation media and installing fresh, cleaning out all the partitions. The drive after doing this will offer you 28.5GB of space and after updates and Office 2016, you wil be left with around 9.5GB free. Definitely worth it for the extra 2 GB.

The lid will not open with one hand. You need two. But, it is smooth.

The laptop is super light and the power adapter is very portable.

I highly recommend it if you need a Chromebook type PC.","6","0"

Resetting it to factory is not possible any more at this point since win 10 requires at least 8 GB just to do a reset with option of wiping out all the files. It becomes a storage ‘trap’ so to say. Screen is very dim and colors are not bright. It is a very poor quality. Under certain light conditions it hurts to look at it. Track pad is not usable. They should not even have bothered to put it there. Had to use mouse with this laptop. Camera produces some image. Speakers are pretty horrible. Can hardly hear at the highest setting. Computing speeds leave much to be desired. Browsing web takes effort for this machine. If you have multiple tabs open that will really slow you down. Office programs is the only thing it handles well. Battery lasts long time. 
I was glad to get rid of this machine. Would never recommend it to a friend or an enemy. Do not fall into this storage trap.

Everything runs fast and the touchpad + keyboard is comfortable, which is all she really needs it for.

The only real downside is the storage space, which is extremely low compared to other laptops. It only has 32 GB of Storage with Flash Memory and about half of that was already being used by programs that came pre-installed on the laptop, which leaves you with about 16-20 GB to play around with. 

That said if all you're planning to do is browse Facebook and watching Youtube and Netflix with a little bit of office work you can't go wrong with this laptop. If you're looking for something that requires you to have a lot of storage you're either gonna need to invest in an external hard drive or consider purchasing something else.","96","6"

This is not enough memory to install Windows and later install some Windows Updates. Windows advises that you need more than 32GB of memory to run Windows and Windows Updates. I just spoke with Lenovo, and while they shift the blame to Windows, they agree that 32GB is not enough memory to run Windows and have enough memory space to download some Windows Updates. So, all in all, a useless machine. I don't understand why it was made in the first place. To be clear, even if you uninstall all your nonessential apps and delete all temporary files and downloads, there is not enough memory on this computer to effectively run Windows and keep it updated. There are some fixes, but it's ridiculous to sell a Windows computer that cannot run Windows and Windows Updates.","5","0"

I can't comment on this computer running Windows, as I pretty much immediately set about removing that in favor of Linux. I didn't even set Windows up.

With the Fedora 27 Cinnamon desktop spin installed, it's a great and relatively responsive machine. 

I almost shied away from this because of the 2GB of RAM (not upgradeable... it's soldered onto the motherboard). 

However, immediately after a reboot, /proc/meminfo shows:
MemFree: 557160 kB
MemAvailable: 987012 kB

Which is plenty.

There is about 18GB of disk space free after installing Fedora 27 with Cinnamon desktop.

All in all, it certainly beats running Crouton on a Samsung Chromebook, which is quite a bit more tedious to set up. It's perfect for a lightweight coding platform (I installed emacs-nox, SublimeText 3, git, and a few other packages)","2","0"

"495","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Natural Silver","Pleasantly Surprised","LarryT","5","My main laptop had been an Asus Q551. Worst laptop I've ever owned. I suffered with it for three years and the lcd panel crapped out. I researched and chose this one. I also looked at a couple of Dells, a Lenovo, and a more expensive HP Spectre.

Display - a tiny bit dark but with a Gamma adjustment it's perfectly fine for everything you'd expect from a sub $1,000 machine. The Full HD resolution serves my needs and didn't feel the need for a 4k display.

Keyboard - spacing I'm familar with. Decent key travel and not too mushy or too clicky. BONUS for me is the numeric pad. I use it all the time and the Dells and Lenovos didn't have it.

Trackpad - GREAT. Has enough texture so as not to be slick. It uses the Synaptics trackpad driver and has every option and adjustment you could ever need. My old Asus had a terrible trackpad that wouldn't recognize taps about half the time and an even worse proprietary drive Asus called ""Smart Gesture"" - a hobbled piece of garbage.

Drive - I LOVE the solid-state drive. Boot time is a fifth of the time compared to a regular hard drive. I wish it was bigger than 256Gb but I've loaded about everything I need to have loaded and am at only ~60% capacity.

Case - Silver aluminum with enough texture to hide fingerprints and is grippy enough to make it hard to slip out of your hands.

Ports - all the standard ports including a USB-C and HDMI. This model doesn't have an RJ-45 for connecting directly to a modem via ethernet cable, but if that's important you can use the USB-C and an adapter to do that. As with pretty much all 15"" laptops, there's no optical (CD, DVD) drive but again you can attach a portable optical drive if you need to. It has a fingerprint reader but I don't use it.

Bloatware - there's a few programs I'll never use but there is one that is quite functional - ""HP Support Assistant"". You can register any HP product with the support assistant to get driver updates and other helpful utilities.

Sound - I always chuckle when someone complains about the sound on a laptop not being as good as their home theater sound system. It's a laptop. However, for a 15"" laptop, the sound is good and strong. Plenty of volume. Everything a reasonable person would expect.

Battery - I usually work plugged in so I can't vouch for the battery. The few times I worked from battery it seemed to hold up nicely.

Wireless Reception - early 2-in-1s suffered from bad design regarding the antenna in the lid. This laptop has as good a wireless range as any laptop I've used in the past several years.

There is one irritating issue with this machine. If you are using headphones connected through the headphone jack, there's a 2-3 second delay from the time the music / video starts to when you start getting sound. This isn't an issue listening through Bluetooth earphones or from the laptop speakers. This is a known issue yet HP hasn't bothered to fix it. This problem is over a year old and affects about every HP laptop. I'd dock this laptop a half star but having to choose between 4 and 5, I still think it's a 5.","4","0"
"496","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Natural Silver","Nice Laptop!","HyTekCat","5","I've had this laptop for approximately 6 weeks now, and it's a solid performer. Quick boot and wake from sleep. Fast storage, and responsive to what you're doing. The design is very good, with a nice array of ports, including HDMI, 2 USB 3 - Type A ports, a USB - Type C port, Card Reader, and a Headphone Jack. Some other features include Touchscreen, Fingerprint Sensor, and Backlit Keyboard. The screen has a pretty solid brightness and clarity, with brilliant colors. Windows 10 is set to a magnification of 125% by default, which made things too big for my liking. I reduced the magnification down to 100%, and that worked out well for me. The audio from its built-in speakers is very good, with a very respectable volume. Of course, don't expect any substantial bass. When I first got this laptop, the B&O native audio app used to have an equalizer built in. That went away with the last update to the app. The app does give you some other audio customizations, though. The Touchpad works very well, and has many customization options, but it's not quite as smooth as a few others out there. I wouldn't call that a problem, though, as it gets the job done well, and there are definitely worse ones out there. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, again not the best I've used, but very good. There are much, much pricier laptops out there with far worse keyboards, in terms of both feel and reliability. The chasis is a nice light silver, and seems to be pretty sturdy to me. The heat exhaust port is on the side of this laptop, which is a great place for it, rather than blowing hot air at the screen. This laptop can get moderately warm under heavy loads, but pretty well stays mildly warm during general use. A good thing. The charger for this laptop can become very warm, until charging is complete. Not much of a concern for me, but good to know. Leaving the charger plugged in to a power outlet, while not connected to the computer is fine. It stays nice and cool. In Windows 10, there is a setting, if you tap on the battery icon, in the system tray, that will allow you to customize the computer's performance, whether on battery or on A/C power. Although is would be a general feature of Windows. This computer will also run Linux. Overall, I do like this computer. I did much research before buying it. Keep in mind, that there is no perfect computer out there. This one was the best choice for me at the time, and I am happy with it. Online and Phone support from HP is definitely better than it was several years ago, but it can still be better. I would say that overall, HP is on the right track, in terms of customer support and user experience. It's good to see that they have stepped up for their customers. Keep it going, HP!","3","0"

I could tell right away this computer is better constructed from last years model, the hinges feel stronger, the fan vent in located on the left side. It is lighting fast with the SSD M.2 . I lost lots of storage switching from last year to this one( last years had 1tb HHD vs 250Gb, and the RAM too, this one only has 12, last years had 16). I can say this newer model is dimmer than last year, but this could be to the fact it has better battery, 12 hrs VS 10 hrs. The things I don’t like about this model is that the SSD is only 256GB, I think it should be 512GB, Windows Hello uses the fingerprint reader rather than the camera, the face recognition is disabled and I haven’t figured out how to enable it, The fingerprint reader located on the right side feels like a small button, and it takes time to get used to, very annoying, the face recognition was better. Another thing I saw at the HP website that with this model that it should come with the pen, however, I don’t see one with the one bought from bestbuy, it could be a mistake with HP I haven’t seen any videos on line to see if it has the space to add an actual SSD drive rather than a M.2 SSD. So far, I like this computer, it logs on in seconds, is light, feels elegant,hinges are better constructed and the things I don’t like are the 256GB SSD, I believe it should be 512, the fingerprint reader on the wrong spot, but those are things I can live with,","16","7"
"498","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Natural Silver","A Speedy and Overall Solid Machine","Pnkr0cker","4","I recently purchased this after having issues with my existing lower-end laptop. It was having some sort of drive issue (drive usage would constantly be at 100% with RAM and CPU usage being low.) Dealing with it was debilitating to say the least, as if you're hard drive is constantly writing while you're CPU/RAM is free, even the simplest of tasks can feel monotonous. 

One night, I started having issues even updating a resume with Word. I got up, went to my local Best Buy to scope out my options. This laptop ticks just about every box I have for a laptop: A touchscreen with no gap between the glass, backlit keyboard, 10-key number pad, sleek metal shell, and even a few more plusses like USB Type-C and fingerprint reader. It having an NVMe SSD and a 4.0Ghz i7 made it an even more obvious choice. 

This machine is quite speedy. I haven't had a reason to really push it's write speed capabilities, but my system is up and ready to go in under 20 seconds. I've yet to encounter a single performance hiccup either. The fingerprint is also very responsive, though admittedly it is in a tricky position.

That brings me to my nit-picks: Nothing totally detrimental honestly. I do feel that for the price, the screen could be a bit brighter with better colors. The 1080p screen redeems it though; test is noticeably more rounded and less jagged compared to the standard laptop resolution. I'm also not a huge fan of the trackpad; It's responsiveness can be quite inconsistent, and I wish the clicking tension was even across the top and bottom. I do wish there was at least one USB SS+ port as well; I don't see a reason for it to be omitted from a $1,000 laptop.

That being said, I'm overall very satisfied with my purchase. If you need a laptop with beefy specs and plenty of convenience features at a reasonable price, you likely will love this device!","1","0"

I recently bought a XPS 13 (7th Gen Processor) for my daughter. I am not going to state what is there already in the professional reviews. I have the Lenovo 4K /16GB/512 SSD model. I initially bought it based on the reviews stating it is the best in the market. I however was delighted to find subtle improvements over the 910. for instance there is a notch on the lid to make it easy to open the laptop now ! The reviews are not doing justice to this laptop. The battery even on the 4 K display is outstanding. As I type this review this laptop is at 15 % power and will still last another 2.30 hours using the suggested battery saver mode ( lasted 10 hours plus, I always drain the battery of the new laptop few times and charge it). The screen is a tad dimmer than the XPS 13. However in every respect this laptop is nothing short of outstanding. Without restating anything already in the PCMag review. I will clarify on a few things the reviews don't stress on. Once someone says something people have a tendency to latch on to it and just repeat it even if they did not really see a problem. The keyboard is not shallow. It is great and with the U shape bottoms and well spaced gaps it is so easy to keep it clean and not fat finger this review for instance. I actually like the minimum key travel. it works great and does not require more force to type ! The Webcam has been moved to the top of the display ! lenovo listens. The display screen is gorgeous with the thin Bezel with great color reproduction. it is a finger print magnet though. I think this is hands down better than the DELL XPS 13 or the HP Spectra 360x models. just so beautifully made. When they compare the weight they say its tad heavier than a XPS 13 but they fail to mention this is a 14 (13.9 inch screen and not a 13.3 inch !) that makes a huge difference for me ! Bigger display but not as bulky and hard to handle as the 51.6 HP spectra 360x. Read the reviews. 
Highly recommend you buy this 14 inch Yoga 920. In fact this is the only 14 inch laptop in its class that has the form factor of a 13 inch !

It is 13.3 inches has an Hdmi port already and longer battery life. Still lightweight and comes with a lightening USB-C charging port. I Loved the speakers on top of the laptop. Now lets get to the Yoga. The sound quality is terrible even though the speakers are JBL because they placed them on the bottom of the computer. So all your sound is basically hitting the table or if the pc is folded into tablet mode, the sound is blocked by the other side of the board.

The one I purchased os the FHD model as well and having a 4k screen is useless when you have to turn down the resolution of the screen or run all your apps in compatibility mode. Basically there are not enough updated apps to make paying a few extra hundred worth the better screen. Go with the model right under this one until more apps are 4K.

I have to run the sims 4 in compatibility mode and reduce the resolution of the display to medium. If I play on ultra HD it makes all the wording and windows to small to be legible. 

I know this is not a gaiming laptop, but it has a decent size SSD and 16 gb Ram. Yet it runs super hot if you are playing the sims for any longer then 5 minutes. I recommend purchasing a fan to go underneath the Yoga to cool it. The vents for this 2-n-1 are behind the watchband hinge so there is not much cooling power on its own when running multiple apps or playing a game. 

It's sounds like I have only mentioned bad stuff about this laptop, but I do typically like it. It is not worth the price I paid but overall it can be useful as a business professional laptop. Its fast with start up. Decent battery life of 10 hours on full 4k display and charges quickly.

This being said, I aske the sales rep whats the difference between the Lenovo Yoga 920 and the HP Spectre x360 was? His response: HP has 13.3 screen and Lenovo has 13.9. Both have same price point and do the same thing, but Lenovo is the better manufacturer. He also said the Lenovo was lighter weight with longer battery life then HP. I found this out later that he lied. The best Buy rep did not know a thing about these computers. The HP has better graphics card, same specs as Lenovo Yoga 920 and last 3 hours longer for battery. 

I love my Yoga because of the watchband Hinge and 13.9 inch screen, but I would like to return it for the HP as I should have went with my 1st mind. Both computers are the same price at Best Buy. 

I have not had a chance to check out the camera quality yet. I would recommend this to a friend, but only after I recommend the HP spectre 1st. I can deal with the slightly smaller screen as a tradeoff for longer battery life and a HDMI port.","3","2"
"504","Lenovo - Yoga 920 2-in-1 13.9"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","Lenovo Makes a Good Product","WNYBarry","4","So I purchased this product after buying a 720 a few months ago, for the quicker processer and larger SSD. This unit came with a stylus very close to the bamboo one I had purchased as a separate buy. It's an upgrade from the previous unit, which is only an I5, but there certainly a few differences between the 2.
1) This unit seems to heat up much faster, and much hotter than the 720. Not sure if it's because the graphics card works harder since it is a 4K display.
2) Both seem very durable, however the watchband hinges on this run across the entire back of the unit, while the 720 only has 2 standard hinges; both seem very secure.

Both seem like very good buys (for sure wait for sales to roll around). The reasons why I like them is they're fast, very mobile, since they are smaller, and weigh less, but still maintain the ability to do quite the workload. Both units are my first 2 units WITHOUT a CD/DVD drive (but let's face it, it's almost an obsolete piece of hardware that not only takes up valuable space, but is an extra draw on the PC - even though negligible). Touch screen is great, Windows Ink works well, but haven't used it for too much more than a few doodles and more toying around than anything else. The 920 comes with a stylus, as well as a piece of plastic you can insert into the old style USB port to ""dock"" your pen. Cool idea, however, it blocks the power/wake button to the right of the device. Placing the button in a different location would have been a better idea. Speaking of USB, both units come with 2 USB- type C ports, as well as ONE old school USB 3.0 port. If you intend to run several devices off this PC (wired external hard drives, CD drives, printers, etc) you will need to buy a few adapters, or buy a hub which will expand current capability, so if you already have these devices, you may still be able to use them.
All in all, I am not disappointed with this buy. I would have given it 5 stars, but again, with how quickly and hot it gets versus the 720, 4 stars (4-1/2 if I could) would be the best I can offer for it. I would recommend this to a friend, but would also advise to wait for a sale.","11","0"

I don't purchase new electronics very often and I'm not wanting to always keep up with the newest devices. This Laptop is everything I was expecting and hoped it would be. Going from a 7 year old, bulky, 17"" screen tradtitional HPlaptop to this is mind blowing. I feel spoiled with the 4K screen. The touch screen was a feature I knew I wanted as well but I was weary of the hinges wearing out over time. Not a concern for me now as it's hinges have proven to be extremely durable. The fingerprint scanner lock works every time (can't say the same for my Pixel 2XL phone), keyboard and touchpad mouse are fluid and comfortable to use, touchscreen is precise. It's extremely lightweight; with a 'bulky' case even, I can toss it in my oversize purse and don't notice a difference. Battery life is phenomenal. I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts, definitely depends on what you're using it for. But I can use it most of an entire day before it needs plugged in. Speaker quality 9/10, although I keep mine connected to my Bose SoundLink II. So far, it cools itself extremely well, placement of fan is practical. I don't have issues with the bottom heating up but the screen/lid does heat up significantly. I'd say 7/10 for cooling/heat production, which is fine by me. Needed the largest SSD as I'm not fond of carrying an external hard drive. My last laptop was 500gb so I needed something comparable. Lightning fast, even with my crap CenturyLink internet speeds. Extremely glad I splurged on this, although I did get an open-box with a few miniscule scratches on the exterior and the pen missing, for $500 off (around $1200). The scratches are unnoticeable and something I probably would have caused on my own anyway, and I just bought a pen separately. I did so much research read SO MANY reviews for a few months prior to purchasing a laptop and narrowed it down to 3 potentials. With the help of one of the PC associates I settled on this open-box. I'm more than happy with my decision to invest in this laptop. If you're thinking about getting this one, just do it. You will not be disappointed.","3","1"

I am basically a Mac person, but needed a PC for some specific software I use for sewing embroidery. My first impressions are:1.it gets very warm underneath, this is lovely in the winter, like holding a hot water bottle, but will not be very nice in a warm climate. 2. there is no documentation with the machine, but I just plugged it in and the assistant Cortana did everything I needed to, very easy. 3. it was not clear from the pen instructions which direction to inert the batteries, I got lucky. Disappointed it isn't rechargeable. 4. Fan is quiet 5. I like the keyboard, I have a light touch and it works well for me. 6. I compared the UHD and the FHD screens side by side in the store. I could tell the difference, and since my work deals with color, I went with the better UHD screen.7. I like that it has one old style usb since I need to import embroidery designs from a usb stick. I didn't have to buy an adaptor like I would for some other machines. 8. I really like the watch band hinge and the slightly bigger screen (13.9 vs 13.3 others). 9. When I got the box it was sooo heavy! Not sure why since the computer only weighs about 3 pounds. The charger wasn't that heavy either. The box itself weighs a lot, maybe for cushioning. 10. This 8550 i7 processor is super fast, love it! Even though this machine probably has much more power than I really need, it is nice to know that because I just purchased a cutting edge machine, it will last a long time before I have to update again. As a Mac user I am liking Windows 10 a lot more than other versions I have worked with.","37","1"

Compared to the MacBook Pro 13 which I have, this computer is faster, has a better screen, and cooler.

The concerns I had based on the reviews I've read here are: A) issues with the touchpad, B) heat, C) battery life.

I'll address all three:

A) Touchpad- so far I haven't seen any issues with it. It's as good to me as the one on my macbook pro. It's smaller than the trackpad on the macbook pro but I've not noticed the size gap.
B) Heat- the only time the computer got uncomfortably warm was when I was loading software and the computer was indexing. Once that was done, the computer stays relatively cool and quiet.
C) Battery- I have not done enough cycles to know accurately what it is. However, based on my limited usage, doing emails, web browsing, Excel, and similar Office apps work, 6+ hours is easily achievable. I have the model with the 4k screen.

I looked at the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and the HP x360 Spectre computers. This Yoga looked to me the best balance of value, features, and weight.

I do have a couple minor quibbles with the computer- 1) I wished it came with Windows 10 Pro (for those of us that need network connectivity) 2) the keyboard backlight doesn't automatically turn on like it does on the mac","4","1"

I was looking for something in the 13-15 inch range and wanted a laptop that was very light. After reviewing the options, I was deciding between the Spectre and the 920 with 4k 16gb and 512. Both of these laptops have the same internal specs including the CPU, GPU, RAM and windows ink abilities. I ultimately purchased the Yoga as the screen size was larger and it was the same price as the Spectre on sale and the weight difference was very small. This thing is beautiful and fast but I still had my doubts as the Spectre was a sleek machine as well, due to the buyers remorse syndrome, I returned to BB to purchase the Spectre to put them head to head. As soon as I opened the Spectre and compared the size and weight to the Yoga, the Yoga started to pull ahead as the screen size is a real plus. In addition, my major concern with the HP is the quality control, the hinges seem to be a major complaint as they are known to weaken. Right out of the box, the hinges were very loose and as I tried to type on my lap, the screen had significant bounce and started to move. Once I picked the laptop up to sit on my couch, the screen laid completely flat. I didn't even bother to boot the machine up as this was a complete deal breaker, I could see the hinge becoming a huge problem with time. 

If you are looking at the Yoga you probably are looking at the Spectre as well, do yourself a favor and get the Yoga, the build quality is fantastic, the screen size is perfect for multi-tasking and the hinge is superb. Great product!!","2","0"

This may be the best laptop that I'm glad to trade my hard earned dollars for. The 4K screen took my eyes a day to get used to (I previously enjoyed the detail of QHD) and now I love it! The bracelet hinge is an engineering triumph - it's firm, durable, and I'm confident that it'll last well beyond the warranty and years of heavy use. I too hesitated on buying this Yoga 920 because of the complaints about the battery life. But, after two weeks of daily use with moderate battery saver settings and normal use, I can attest that the laptop ran for over 9 hours with 10% still left to spare. I kept the brightness at 80-90%, shut off auto sleep mode, screen turns off after 3 mins, and other settings are moderate settings and not the extreme. I perform remote access and run various MS Office apps locally, so power and network use is consistently active, but not extreme CPU nor GPU activity. The battery power, life, and quick charge are all fantastic (versus my old ASUS that lasted 4-5 hours.) So, with all the other unquestionable features (light-weight, multiple ports, fast charge, Bluetooth pen, aluminum case) this 2-in-1 is awesome. Just two other observations - the power supply is your traditional brick with cords on both ends (it would have been nice to have the modern style of a one-sided cord with a more compact brick with a flip in/out two-prong plug) and the laptop does run almost hot when Windows is busy performing Win Updates or running a full virus scan, but the vent design is brilliant with the intake and exhaust vents in the back, so when the 2-in-1 is on my lap, I'm not blocking the circulation.","3","0"

1. Battery life much lower than spec'd, unless it's an error in the remaining estimated battery time. I'm showing only 3 hours on a full charge! I do like to keep the brightness pretty high, but I'm not doing anything more than browsing the web and watching netflix.

2. No Windows Hello via camera. The fingerprint sensor works great, but it would be nice to have facial recognition when in tablet mode.

3. Fans get loud with dolby sound enabled

4. Viewing angles and backlight bleed is a serious issue when viewing dark video. The blacks aren't as deep as expected, but other colors are vivid. 

5. Included lenovo power settings conflict with windows power settings. Another issue I've had is the microphone being disabled randomly, which makes the long range mic pointless if you want to use Cortana.

All around it's still probably the best 2 in 1 on the market, but they really need to push out updates to fix the current issues. I'm going to contact lenovo support, but if they can't help me out I will likely return it and grab the new surface book.","26","5"

I was excited to finally have an top notch laptop with beautiful design and great tech specific. However, I got only problems. After buying the ""first"" Yoga Lenovo 920 laptop on Black Friday I noticed frequent interruption in the internet connection (which didn't happen with my old laptop nor other devices at home). Then I returned it right away. 
I got the ""second"" yoga lenovo 920 (same model) and the wifi problems kept happening but less frequent, it also made my router to ""shut down"". We updated the router and I tried the computer at the university, and the internet disconnection occurred again, less frequent but still happened. I took my laptop to best buy to the Geek Squad, and told them the problem, they did something but it didn't solved the issue. Came back to Best buy and they send it to another store to replace the Wifi card and once that I got it, still the same internet interruptions. So, now I am over the returning time, and have a laptop with no reliable wifi, and nobody knows what happens. I hope LENOVO take this into account to review this model and see if it is a software problem since they replace the wifi card. Browsing online I found out that is common for this model to have that issue, I tried to troubleshoot with the directions in the lenovo blog with not success","2","1"

The form factor and build quality are excellent. the performance is first rate. 

The weakness, if it is one, is the battery life, which on the 4K model looks to be in the area of 3 1/2 hours, maybe 4 1/2 hours, with light to moderate use. 

I called Lenovo and they confirmed this. Lenovo's technical support stated that they felt that I could expect 3 to 4 hours of run time with moderate to light use, and that the rated battery life of 10.8 hours was at idle with the machine doing no work. I confirmed this with a second person at Lenovo. 

This is not surprising given the screen and the form factor of the machine, but it is important to know when buying the machine.

That said, I can recommend this machine if you do not depend upon extensive battery life as part of your prerequisites for a laptop. I think that apart from a somewhat short battery life this is a near-perfect machine.","7","0"

"528","Microsoft - Surface Pro - 12.3"" Touch-Screen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB SSD with Platinum Type Cover (Latest Model) - Silver","Impressive but the battery life, slow installs","Cherry2Pie","4","The screen on the surface pro is impressive. The resolution looks astounding and the colors truly pop. For the most part, the surface is snappy and fast except for installations of updates, programs, and apps. When the surface is installing updates or programs like adobe reader or browsers it is utterly sluggish and slow. Downloads from the internet are also slower on this as oppossed to a way older laptop i have. I have 200MBPS internet dwnld speed and verified my internet quality, but i notice the slowness with the surface. I dont plan on frequent downloads or installs of programs so this is not a huge deal breaker but just an annoyance. 

I specifically reviewed the reviews about the battery life before making this purchase and saw that all reviews report impeccable battery life. The specifications report 13.5 hrs (with video watching and defaults including auto brightness). WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?? I am no gamer or photo editor and i consider myself a very light user. I have turned off ALL radios, location settings, onedrive, and any other data consuming app or setting on my surface that may drain the battery. My battery setting is on the 2nd level- the Recommended level with 33% or 40% screen brightness not enough to fully enjoy the popping screen colors and yet i am only getting about 4 to 6 hours of battery with this on internet browsing, typing on word, or looking at the different settings of the OS. Sometimes the keyboard light is on, sometimes its off. I have literally searched every part of the OS to find anything else draining the battery, i tested shutting down the system and also letting it sleep with airplane mode on for overnight and theres no difference. I also allowed the surface to die of depleting battery to recharge it back to a 100% (found this suggestion through Microsoft's website). If you google ""battery life"", results will show that the surface battery is nowhere near 13.5 hrs and reports also have that feature as a con of this device. So i question every review on here to please let me know what settings you have and how you use the system to report awesome battery life. With this said, i don't know whether to believe if the reviews are biased towards the battery/product or if somehow I potentially have a defect... 

Aside from the battery, i am very impressed with this system, especially the touchpad and the keyboard. It is just like a laptop keybaord and is comfortable to type on. The touchpad is super smooth. I would prefer to have Home and End buttons on the right of the layout but i can engage in a learning curve to get use to them at the top. I also would like to see the number pad incorporated on the dedicated letter keys like some laptops have on their keybaords as well. The SD mini crd slot is a nice plus but Microsoft should have included at the minimum, 2 usb's not just 1. I will have to buy the MS dock for $175 to use USB devices simultaneously. One other nuance is that i noticed from removing and inserting my usb devices on the surface, some of the metal or silver paint chips away in little particles as if producing wear and tear on the inside of the usb area of the surface. I hope my usb connections dont become damage by this and was also expecting to see better quality in this area.

In reality the surface is just like every other Windows laptop/tablet with its own proprietary design, materials, and parts. The biggest thing going for it IMO is the screen brightness and resolution. But this actually falls short on battery life, I/O, SSD space, and swiftness on certain usage with the system. 

Perhaps the battery will magically get better over time, that is my main regret and dissapointment with the surface purchase so far. I would be ecstatic about this product if only the PC would last an adequate amount of time per the way i interact with it. Its not a hidden secret that consumers want computers to have adequate ports, storage space, and true battery life that matches everyday usage not just watching videos and auto brightness that dims the screen excessively. I would hope that Microsoft implements this general consensus in their future models of the surface. Luckily i got this on sale.","3","0"
"529","Microsoft - Surface Pro - 12.3"" Touch-Screen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB SSD with Platinum Type Cover (Latest Model) - Silver","Love it!","Yakir","5","After long comparisons and research, I decided to buy the Surface Pro. Everybody is different in their preferences and for me, initially the thing that I cared about the most was going through specs trying to find the laptop that is suitable to me and would give me the performance I need.
However upon a close inspection of the different laptops from other brands and Microsoft, user experience came to mind, which to me suddenly it became to my awareness.
In terms of user experience, Microsoft has done so many things right, I would probably miss to mention them all.
The screen for example is incredible, it is color accurate and very sharp with very high resolution, it is one of the brightest as well so there is no problem using it outdoors. It also has 3:2 aspect ratio which is superb for productivity. Since it is so sharp and high resolution and quality, you won't even feel like you need a larger screen as you fit all that you need in it .
The user experience goes more to how great it feels to use it, the way the keyboard, the mouse, the hinge and more.
Takes it to the level of Apple in terms of everything fits together with the operating system with an amazing user experience.
Also there is no fan, so it stays silent.
There are battery modes integrated in Windows 10 to choose from that really match your needs whether you want to save energy or prefer performance.

In terms of the physical dimensions: 
I wanted something that is compact and lightweight that would fit a small bag in case I want to carry it all day and cycling with it to some coffee shops and get work done. Many laptops these days are much more light and compact than they used to, but still, this one takes it to the next level of being almost light as an iPad, especially if you take the keyboard off which there is no reason to do that as it is light enough.
It is also admirable and remarkable, especially since this is a full I5 CPU which packs in serious power.

Build materials:
It feels solid and strong despite the light weight of it.
Everything in it including the sophisticated hinge, the keyboard itself and the magnetic keyboard attachment mechanism, show strong material choices and design.
Also very pleasant to touch and use the keyboard and the trackpad. The keyboard is one of the best I've tried, it is accurate, have good key travel, comfortable and not noisy, suitable for quiet environments as well. The texture of the keyboard and the trackpad is very pleasant. 

Battery life is amazing!

Performance:
There is an 8th gen now with quad core in the competitors laptops and the Surface Pro has the 7th gen dual core, which I was skeptical about, but it gives me what I need and more, as it is a fast machine I am still suprised by it's capabilities.
I'm a programmer and I feel like it gives me definitely everything I need running few IDEs at once, running virtual machines etc..
For really serious video editing, in case you are a content creator or a film maker that has to have their edits as soon as possible on the go, as high end as you can get, the better. So there will be higher end laptops.
However for most of us including various pro users, this machine is more than capable to fill any need fast.

Got the pen and it is working amazingly well.
Got a 128 SD card to put all my multimedia files and I'm good in terms of storage.

In conclusion, very happy with my purchase.","7","1"

This is the definition of a refined product. Rather than trying some new design from Surface Pro 4 to this 2017 Surface Pro, MS just worked on perfecting the Surface Pro 4 which yielded this version. I was so impressed I decided to get the pen as well (which I didn't think I would) to see if that would also exceed my expectation, and yep, it did! The screen is beautiful, battery life perfect, speed excellent, ease of use is through the roof! Easy, fast, simple, and it will make you more productive than any other product!! I use this primarily as a student and a little with my work. The skin I have is a dbrand carbon fiber skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop or a tablet (or both obviously) and would not recommend this to anyone looking to game (a true gamer does not mobile game he uses a desktop with the latest nvidia graphics card in SLI-anyone looking to game on a laptop is a disgrace and I ask you to stop reading my review). Of all the surface pro configurations this will be the best configuration for most users as the fanless i5 has the best battery life and you don't need an i7 for laptop/tablet purposes-it would just be a waste of money. 128gb ssd is the best b/c any higher is just more money, and why in gods name do you need more storage on a laptop in 2018? Use the cloud people! 8GB ram is the sweet spot. 4GB is unacceptable and it's sad MS even offers that. 16gb is overkill for laptop/tablet functions in MOST cases. If you're an extreme video editor on the go then go 16, otherwise 8gb is perfect with room to spare :). Of course the other reason to go with this configuration is the great sale best buy has! 799 is a steal of a deal, I would have easily paid triple for this had I known just how great it is before. This is the laptop to end all laptops.","12","9"

It's not what everyone wants or needs, but if you know you want a Surface, with an I5, this is the package to get. Only drawback is that it only comes with the platinum keyboard. That would have been my choice anyway. If you just have to have red or blue, it'll cost you $160. Maybe you can sell the platinum one ;)","1","0"

I made a purchase decision based on a visit to the HP site with the Best Buy clerk in attendance. I've been in contact with HP Support for an hour last night: they say they'll get back to me tomorrow. The Passmark score for this SanDisk drive is only 4,000 while typical NVMe drives are at least triple that. I wouldn't buy a system with such a low-capacity SSD unless it was NVMe.

Windows Update is agonizingly slow too for a system that is supposed to be fast: two fails with the Windows 1803 Feature Update.

The positives: programs load very fast and the system is responsive. Build quality is adequate. Battery life is fair too. For most folks, this is a fine system but I really would prefer that the system specs matched those promised on the HP web site.","8","0"

I'm impressed with the speed of this laptop, and was holding out for something with these specs and price point. Glad I waited as this is a brand new release from HP.

The keyboard actually feels great - not cheap or clicky at all. Touchscreen is perfect and responsive and the fact it converts into a tablet is a big bonus.

Only thing this doesn't have is a backlit keyboard, but that's just fine for her use.

This is our 3rd Envy 360 in the family, and so far with each one we've been overly impressed and satisfied.

I have bought two Laptops so far this summer for Back to School period. 

This one has a great price and a lot of features and my boy loved it immediately. Nevertheless I have to confess that I bought it for the price. 
The screen it's not the best and the HDD speed is awful, at best. I can live with the screen but not with the speed so I bought an SSD of the same size 500GB, and now its flying!!! 

It's an easy process just buy the disk, perform an System Image from Windows to an USB Drive and create a Bootable USB Disk. Remove the old drive, put the new one in and boot from the bootable USB drive. Look for System Image Restore in the the Windows 10 recovery and start the process. Speed won't be an issue anymore.","2","0"

"545","Lenovo - IdeaPad 11.6"" Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Mineral Gray","Good Dirt cheap laptop!!!! ","JellymanProject","4","I am going to start bey saying that I am quite impressed by this laptop. Though the computer come with an intel celeron N3060 and only 2 GB ram and only 32GB storage, its quite a good machine. 
Pros: quite fast, runs quiet, doesn't heat up, has a fantastic matte screen and decent battery life. The keyboard is very decent and I would say perfect size that gives you a very good typing experience. The track pad is also very responsive compared to most laptops in this price range. 
Cons: Not fit for gaming because of the GPU, The screen is only 1366x 768 (though I personally feel that its perfect resolution for the screen size), 32GB storage is simply not enough for 2017. Personally it feels like I am in the late 90s when 30GB disk space was like having 1TB in 2017 (The product also comes with an micro SD slot, so you can add additional storage space) . 
Who is this laptop for ?: This a is a perfect fit for those who are in school or those who don't need to run heavy applications. Definitely not for running vmware or virtualbox. This computer is however perfect for typing documents on MS-Office or Google Docs or other editing applications of your choice that is not very power hungry. You might also be able to run applications like SQL Server management studio 2014 express edition with local DB, Sublime text, notepad++ or even a few IDE for programming. But remember that it only has 32GB or total storage! I installed Google chrome, Firefox, Opera browser, and git-scm(32bit) after which roughly 5GB storage space was left. highly recommend getting a micro-SD card to store all your documents and using the internal storage only for applications. 
Over all I have no complain about this computer. This is a replacement for my mid-2012 Macbook Pro. The only complain I have about the Windows operating system is that it is not as perfect as it was visually compared to windows XP. I bought other windows 10 computers with 1080p resolution (screen size(13.3 to 15.6 ) and I was quite disappointed with the visual scaling. Though windows 10 has the scale and layout option, I notices that if you use anything more than 100% it often makes the menus and others things blurry, which was not an issue in windows XP. Between this and my Mac I will definitely miss OSX and Quick Time – Best screen recording software I have ever used. But what I am definitely not going to miss is the skin burns I had to suffer using the Mac. 
In conclusion, you can’t get a laptop better than this for less than $200!!!!","36","0"
"546","Lenovo - IdeaPad 11.6"" Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Mineral Gray","Affordable; 64-bit Windows; Backup & Upgrade Tips","thoughtfulbuyer","4","This laptop was an incredible Black Friday 2017 deal. Small and light, it runs Windows, which makes it a ""real"" computer, able to run arbitrary programs, not just tablet-style apps.

I've upgraded to Windows 10 Fall 2017 Creators Edition. I've also installed Microsoft's Linux Subsystem, so that I can use Ubuntu from inside Windows. The result is a very-low-cost platform for serious software development.

Contrary to some of the questions-and-answers, the preinstalled Windows 10 Home version IS 64-bit. The build number is 1703, from mid-2017. As other reviewers have mentioned, in-place upgrades will fail unless you free up space on the 32 GB solid-state disk.

This machine ships without recovery media. After running through the usual ""getting started"" steps for a new Windows PC, disconnect from your wireless network and open Control Panel > System and Security > Backup and Restore (Windows 7). [Yes, the feature is holdover from Windows 7!] Plug in a USB external DVD writer (not supplied) and use the two links on the left side of the control panel to create a system image (fills two 9 GB double-layer writable DVDs) and a repair disc (one 4.5 GB single-layer DVD will suffice). Sadly, you must have an optical drive; Windows will not let you use a microSD card, USB flash drive, or external hard drive for this type of backup. Disconnecting from network stops Windows from downloading updates; too much write activity on the internal SSD would kill the ""shadow file"", causing the backup to fail just before the end.

After taking a full backup, I ran Disk Cleanup on C:/ and also got rid of the ""bloatware"" that comes preinstalled on any low-cost PC.

You can safely remove all of the manufacturer's applications except Companion, which is handy for updating drivers and controlling certain hardware features. The anti-virus software, which is, after all, just a one-year trial, can also be removed. (Turn on Windows 10's built-in equivalent.) Once you've activated the free one-year Office 365 subscription, you can delete that big package, too. (Reinstall it later, over the Internet. The entitlement is stored in your Microsoft Account.) The folder on C:/ containing 200 MB of uncompressed PDF manuals, in every possible language, can be temporarily moved to a USB flash drive.

These steps will free more than enough space for an upgrade to the latest Windows 10 build.","17","0"

I say this because I bought this laptop only to run Microsoft Office apps and to occasionally do e-mail and surf the web. I have not installed any other apps on this computer, and I haven't even used it that much, but after a few Windows 10 updates it now boots up slower, runs slower, occasionally freezes and takes longer to shut down than my old computer, which my kids had installed all kinds of resource-sapping junk on, and which is also infected with Windows 10.

And here's what REALLY annoys me: Microsoft keeps sending me notifications that I need to install the latest Windows 10 Security update - Which requires 10 GIGABYTES of hard-disk space - and now says that Microsoft product support will end for Windows 10 unless I install the next System Update before April 10, which requires 6 GB of drive space. This poses a huge problem on several levels, and here's why: First off, even though this computer is advertised as having a 32GB hard drive, the actual capacity of the hard drive is closer to 28 GB according to File Explorer. Second, with no other apps installed, 24 GB of that drive space is taken up by Windows all by itself. If you haven't done the math, that means there is 4 GB of free HD space. I installed a 64GB MicroSD card in the memory slot, but Windows will not let me download the updates to it. So, unless I am misunderstanding something, it's impossible to upgrade this computer to the standard Microsoft requires to continue offering support for their already unsatisfactory product. This, on a product that is less than one year old!

I am SO done with Windows. Next time, it's a Chromebook (or a Mac) for sure.","17","11"

First of all this laptop doesn't have enough hard drive space so your going to have to uninstall the crap Lenovo installed. I uninstalled the 4 games and saved over 1GB of hard drive space. Second issue is the processor just meets the minimum requirements set by Microsoft. So, do yourself a favor and uninstall the default Antivirus and just use Windows Defender. Virtually all of the Aftermarket Antivirus Products will ""cripple"" the performance of this laptop and you will never be Happy. Second issue is ""Syncing"" to the ""Cloud"".

Let me tell you I am enjoying this laptop immensely. Here is my tip of the week; when you first turn on your laptop it is going to ask you for your WiFi router password, skip this part because it will take 5 hours to install all the updates and you won't be able to do anything on your brand new laptop. Uninstall all the crap and get the laptop humming like a champ and reboot. When your all done enter your wifi password.

For $200, I've got a laptop that browses the web just fine (only gets hung up on websites with a TON of flash content, and only for a second or two), runs both Microsoft Office 365 and Google Docs/Sheets with no hiccups, and I can even do some light gaming on it. I've played Stardew Valley and FTL without any slowdowns - it won't do current major AAA titles, but that's not what you should be buying this laptop for.

Cons:
Poor speakers (ended up buying a Bluetooth speaker to use)
Mediocre display - looks great straight on, gets some discoloration at angles
32GB of onboard storage

Pros:
Micro SD slot to expand storage - put a 128GB card in and have had no issues saving to it
Great keyboard and trackpad
Regularly get a full day's use out of one battery charge
Great build - feels sturdy, doesn't get hot or make noise

In a nutshell - if all you need is a device to browse the web, do some document editing, and play some light games, you can't do much better for $200. Plan on spending a little more money down the line to get a Bluetooth speaker and a Micro SD card, and I think you'll be very pleased.","13","0"

When searched on internet, I found 1000s of unsatisfied customer who had this power issue after the first year. Calling Lenovo was of no use, they said it was out of warrently and asked me to take it back to best buy. Obviously best buy would not do anything, as I do not have Geek squad coverage.

The modern USB 3.0 ports and USB C is nice, as well as the MicroSD card reader.

There is no fan - it is dead silent. Typing on the keyboard is pretty quiet, also.

After answering a few preference questions, the computer runs its start up operations. From start to finish – including updates – the HP Envy took approximately 10 minutes to finalize its start up. After that was completed, I noticed one thing right off the bat – the temperature of the computer. I used a Infrared Thermometer to take the surface temperature of the laptop in a few different places. I got readings between 104 and 107 degrees Fahrenheit. I also used an infrared camera (FLIR One) to take a few shots of the heat signature from the top and bottom of the computer. After taking those readings, I did notice that the heat dissipated quickly. After the initial set-up, I began doing my testing.

BASIC COMPUTING SKILLS

One of the main things I use computers (and laptops) for is to type. I do a lot of writing and therefore, how responsive a keyboard is to me and how it feels is very important to my overall experience with a laptop. I enjoy the fact that the screen is touch sensitive. That makes it easy to transition between tablet, phone, and computer. I can't tell you how many times I have gone to touch a screen on a laptop to only be disappointed that the screen isn't a touchscreen. Given that comfortable typing is a big feature for me, I usually complete an online typing test to see what my speed is like. I then compare that to my speed on my MacBook Pro. In this instance, typing on the HP Envy was much more efficient than it was on my MBP. I had a speed of 70WPM on the Envy and on the MBP, it was 65WPM. The keyboard is quite responsive and the keys have a softer feel to them. It's very quiet to type on the Envy and the spacing of the keys is comfortable. 

CPU/GPU PERFORMANCE

The HP Envy has been running very smoothly. It's been very responsive and able to handle the tasks I've thrown at it. Given that this computer is mainly built for gaming and application performance, those are the main areas that I was testing when I was using the laptop. To measure the performance of the GPU and CPU, I used two benchmarking tools – Geekbench 4 and NovaBench.

Geekbench 4 Results

The HP Envy 360x ended up with a single-core score of 2264 and a multi-core score of 6698. It also returned an OpenCL score of 31731. According to other Geekbench 4 results, the top scoring machine with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor is 4782/17291. In this regard, the HP Envy is performing below the top performing machine. The OpenCL test looks specifically at how well the GPU performs. The HP Envy has an AMD Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics chipset with shared video memory. It's designed to provide solid image quality for Internet usage, movies, basic photo editing, and casual gaming. Looking at other AMD Radeon Vega 8 GPUs that have been tested on Geekbench, the average score is 33515. With that in mind, the HP Envy's GPU is performing a bit below the average. 

NovaBench Results

NovaBench does a similar type of testing on your system but provides you with a different set of scores and analysis. The overall score of the HP Envy was 1090 and had a CPU score of 638 and GPU score of 203. I can’t say which test works better — they are just different. 

BATTERY PERFORMANCE

According to the specs from HP, this laptop should work up to 10 hours (depending on the display panel that is installed). During my testing of this laptop, I tried to make note of how long the battery was lasting depending on the task being run at the time. When I first pulled the laptop out of its box, I placed it on charge for a big and then unplugged it as I started working with it. Starting with 81% battery, I noted that after about 3 hours, the battery had drained by 71%. At 10%, the computer gives you a warning about a low battery, so I plugged it into AC power at that point. During those 3 hours, I was running the tests I mentioned above and getting the computer set-up. I also began running Windows system updates. With this timing in mind, I think I can estimate an approximate battery life that will last a little over 4 hours if it's being vigorously used like I was doing. 

HARD DRIVE SPEED

Finally, I wanted to test the hard drive's speed. This model of the HP Envy comes with 128GB PCIe SSD. According to the stress test I used (32GB), the top read/write speed of this SSD is 513/282 MB/s. This was a little disappointing considering that I did a test on a Razer Blade Stealth a few months ago and its read/write speeds with a 16GB stress test was 3153/1113 MB/s. It, too, had a PCI-e SSD. 

ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE

The last two features I looked at with the HP Envy had to deal with how well the computer handled entertainment like streaming video and gaming. Using Netflix, I watched the introduction to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The movie opens with a vibrant color pallette, extrodinary special effects mixed with human actors, and an eclectic music soundtrack. This combination of elements makes it an awesome test for both the display and speaker set for the HP Envy. I was very impressed by how good the picture looked on the screen. It was immaculate. The audio was well-amplified and easy to understand so I would rate the speakers at 'above average' for a laptop. 

In addition to the video trial, I also downloaded and played a few rounds of Sonic Dash. The game graphics held up very well and gameplay was smooth. Since this game is very fast-paced, I would expect that the HP Envy would hold up well with other types of gameplay, too. 

CONCLUSION

The HP Envy is a wonderful multi-purpose laptop. It's above average for a standard performance laptop, but not up to par with 'gaming' laptops or custom builds. I would recommend this for users who are looking for one machine to accomplish many different tasks.","3","0"
"557","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash Silver","An amazingly light, beautiful speed demon!","Shaunh20","5","I recently got a large laptop for gaming but needed something for on-the-go that was lightweight and portable but yet powerful. I have been eyeballing the new Macs but they are just too expensive so I was looking for something much like it. The HP Envy x360 first caught my attention a few months ago on CNET and I thought I'd give it a try. The AMD Ryzen 5 would be my first attempt to go with an AMD machine since my disastrous Falcon Northwest back in 2005 which did not go well. But considering the price/value and the years since I figured I would give AMD a try once again. A solid state drive was a no-brainer and I really did not need a big hard drive since I hadn't planned on using this system for games or anything heavy hitting.

Once I received the HP Envy x360 I must say that I was very, very impressed with the very beautiful aesthetics of the machine. Sure the Macs are beautiful and pretty much the standard for how a minimalist but yet powerful machine should look but the HP Envy matches it and, in some ways, even surpasses it. Setting it up was very easy and took minimal input from me. It was really nice to be able to fire it up, it boot very fast (that SSD, wow) and then answered some questions via Cortana and we were in Windows 10 and up and running in no time. Sure we had some updates to do and some drivers, etc to download so that took a couple of hours but it all was stuff that ran in the background while I watched TV and tinkered on my desktop. The HP Envy does come with some HP utilities installed but they seemed to be quite useful and unlike many of Dell's offerings I actually left most everything on the machine with the exception of the McAfee Virus software 30 day trial which was uninstalled and replaced with Bitdefender. Everything else was left on and seemed quite useful (utilities to demonstrate how to use the notebook, diagnostic tools, ways to contact HP, etc).

Having had the machine up and running now for over a week I can say that it's super fast, probably the fastest machine I have ever run, aside from my SSD based desktop, and fully functional with really no issues at all. The face scanning software that the PC uses to unlock the laptop works phenomenally well, not once did it ever fail even when I was unshaven, shaven and everything in between. I really like that software and am actually considering buying some form of it for my desktop. The touch screen works amazingly well too, although I've not had the opportunity to use the stylus on the screen as that is an additional $69 (although check your model as some models do come with the stylus)

The only real negatives I can think of in regards to this machine is, again it is not a gaming notebook. The video memory is low (2Gb) and there just isn't a lot of hard drive space to install much games. I believe I had about 70Gb free on the 128Gb hard drive once I was completely done installing all of my apps, virus checker, etc. Now as for it not running games: I mean modern games like Forza Motorsport 7, Overwatch, PUBG, etc. It runs Candy Crush and typical ""light"" games quite well. Speaking of graphics, the display, of course, is absolutely stunning. 

If you're looking for an on-the-go notebook I'd highly recommend the HP Envy x360. With incredible speed, absolutely stunning graphics, a light & portable design, beautiful aesthetics and outrageously long (12-13 hours) of battery life I cannot recommend it enough. Just be aware you may need to add an external drive of some sort if you use many apps, or just go ahead and get a bigger SSD, like the 256Gb version, out of the box. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!","1","0"
"558","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash Silver","Great Portable Laptop for casual use","dlowen","4","I will start out this review by saying that this laptop is not going to be for everyone. However. It blew my expectations away because of its design. 

I will start this review off by talking about the design. It is not a cheap laptop so of course you would not expect it to be cheaply designed. However, most sub $1000 laptops are made of plastic and cheaper materials. I am a big fan of the way MacBook’s are designed because of their premium feel. That is exactly how this laptop felt when I pulled it out of the box. It has a very nice aluminum design that is both light and very premium feeling. It is a very thin laptop hence the ENVY name and can easily be carried around. The only fault I found with the aluminum is that it is a finger print magnet. Just after carrying it around for a little the entire body was covered in fingerprints. The screen is a beautiful screen. It is a 13 in touch screen which looks and functions amazingly. I love how it has very thin bezels it makes the laptop look that much better. Possibly my favorite part of the entire laptop is the keyboard. It can be tricky to pack a great keyboard into such a small package, but HP managed to do it with this computer. The keys have just the perfect amount of travel, they are also very quiet and make for nice typing. The keys are also nicely spaced, and it is very easy and comfortable to type on for long periods of time. The keyboard is also backlit, but it does not seem like you can adjust the brightness. This is not a big deal. The trackpad is on the better side of trackpads. It has very nice feedback and the size is decent considering the overall size of this computer. I would still prefer to use a mouse over most trackpads, but it will work perfectly when needed. The laptop has a convertible design that allows the screen to do a complete 360. The hinges felt very durable and turned into a nice tablet with the screen placed in the completed folded position. I also like that you can pro it up and that would allow you to draw or use the touch screen without worrying about the keyboard. As far as ports this laptop has a decent amount of ports for its size. It comes with two full size USB ports, 1 USB C port, a head phone jack and a micro SD card slot. It a nice that it includes both regular USB and USB C. The only difference I would have liked to see is a full size SD instead of micro SD. Possibly the biggest design flaw is the charger! Almost every new laptop now can charge off USB C and this laptop still has a proprietary charger. This is a huge let down because with USB C you can more universally charge the computer and use mobile power banks to charge it. 

In terms of performance and features this laptop has some decent specs. I personally like intel processors better than AMD but this processor definitely packs power. I would not go as far as to say this laptop would be good for gaming or anything highly graphic intensive. However, it can handle day to day business or light video or photo editing although it could start to slow up. The one downside to this model is only 128gb SSD. I would recommend getting one with a larger SSD if you plan to download a lot of software or store any type of data on the laptop. The laptop comes with Bang and Olufsen speakers which sound great. The only downside I found to the speakers is that they do not get very loud. Even after tweaking some settings and turning them to full volume they will not fill up a room. As small and portable this laptop is I do not think this will be a problem at all. One feature that I did not know this laptop had was facial recognition. It also has infrared sensors so that it can work in the dark. The only downside to this software was that it had a hard time recognizing me if I changed my appearance such as wearing a hat. The more I played with it the better it became, and it worked extremely fast. One large disappointment was the amount of HP bloatware that came installed on the computer. It is easy to uninstall it all but if it was all grouped into one app or two that would be much better then about 10 that it came with. 

As far as upgradability, this laptop is not easily if at all upgradable. I would recommend spec’ing it out before you buy it because not much is upgradable, and I was not even able to get inside of the laptop because it uses a special tool. 

Overall, this is a very decent laptop for the price. It holds true to the high-quality name that HP is known for. I believe that it is a great laptop for students or business people who need something that is easy to carry around a portable. This would not be recommended for anyone that needs a highly spec’d out laptop for heavy gaming or intensive graphic usage.","5","2"
"559","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash Silver","360 feature might be a waste of $ for most","bridaw","5","This is a great laptop. My Bamboo Ink stylus won’t arrive until next week, so I’ll post a comment to update my review. Our other Win10 laptop and Chromebook are also touchscreen, very handy. I like the 360 feature to switch between laptop and tablet but I don’t have much use for a windows tablet. I like our 360 Chromebook because I can use it as a laptop for 90% of my needs and play many of my android games.

Charging: Two methods. 1) Dedicated power port for the included two-piece power cord. 2) USB Type-C port. This is convenient because I can use one AC adapter with a USB Type-C port + USB-C cable to charge my Chromebook, MateBook and this HP Envy. I can leave the HP single-purpose power cord behind.

Screen: The 1920 x 1080 resolution screen looks great but the 16:9 aspect ratio wastes space. I’d much rather have a 3:2 screen with smaller bezels and more screen. This isn’t a phone where a 16:9 or 18:9 (2:1) ratio makes the overall device smaller and easier to hold in one hand. Tablet mode doesn’t benefit from this ratio either because you are still holding a device with 3:2 physical format while looking at a smaller 18:9 screen. I don’t use the camera enough to be happy sacrificing ½” of screen and then the HP logo wasting 1” of space. Give me that space in a 3:2 format screen. Online course, browsing the web, reading mail, games… EVERYTHING. How often do you wish you had LESS screen.

Keyboard: There is enough travel to feel mechanical in this modern laptop age without feeling flat or mushy. I like the feel of these keys more than our MateBook. I’m middle aged so I appreciate the large font on these keys, easier to see. The keyboard backlight is too bright and doesn’t time out. Too bright is subjective but no timeout? There is only one brightness level -mostly too bright. I use the windows “Night Light” feature (blue light filter) in the evening and the bright glare spilling from underneath this keyboard is too much. When I am mostly working with the trackpad I toggle the keyboard light off and on again as needed.

The down arrow direction key to the right of the trackpad is the worst offender followed by the ENTIRE top row of function keys. The glare from underneath these keys is distracting. Looking directly down at the keyboard isn’t a problem. I’m 6’2” and with the laptop in my lap, my viewing angle puts the glare directly in my eyes. The full-strength light spilling out from under the keyboard is much brighter than the diffused light from the surface of the keys. Distracting enough but the flaw is magnified when you have “Night Light” maxed on the warmest color setting. Sometimes I leave the key backlight on during the day and I still find it too bright.

Trackpad: Tad too short. While customizing my wife’s start menu I ran out of room on the trackpad. Annoying but you learn to work around. I try to use a mouse whenever I can, but it would be nice to have more trackpad when scrolling up and down. Side to side is fine, plenty wide. 

Sound: Obviously subjective. My family compared the same songs on our Matebook X Pro and they both sound great. The MateBook sounds better but it costs more and doesn’t need to double as a tablet. Your youtube videos will sound awesome but for music -headphones, Bluetooth or Cast.

Too many stickers. Once they are all gone the branding on the laptop is minimal.

Heat vent: Most modern laptops vent heat near the hinge at the display. This has a side vent to support the 360/tablet mode and it works well. Reminds me of old laptops. Not a problem on a table but it might get toasty on your thigh. Really only an issue with games.

Battery: It depends on usage, right? I find I need to charge (or use while plugged in) more than our 1st win10 touchscreen laptop.","4","0"

Having completely switched to Macs when Windows 8 came out, I was ready to have a PC in my life. This is mainly due to some annoying pet peeves such as my NAS drive mappings wouldn’t stay mapped and I couldn’t get used to Excel shortcuts, some other annoyances here and there which I won’t get into.
The first thing you’ll notice when you pick up the HP Envy X360 is the light weight and sharp (even sexy) design. It’s one of the nicer, if not the nicest, Windows laptops I’ve seen. Not quite a Macbook Pro, but nowhere near the price either. In the box, you will find the laptop, a charger and a cord that snaps into the charger. A pen for the tablet is not included, its an optional accessory. 

First impressions:
As I said above, the laptop design is very nice, very thin and fairly minimal (once all 4 stickers are removed). The dark grey color gives it a unique, high tech look. The fit and finish is very good, I didn’t notice any defects even up close. The keyboard is a good size and has a backlight that can be turned on or off but cannot be dimmed. The sound from the Bang & Olufsen speakers are adequate, not the best sound, but for some music while you’re working, sound for a movie playing, it’s fine. If you want better sound, connect a good Bluetooth speaker to it. To adjust the volume, there are physical keys as well as a keyboard shortcut, this is so the volume can be adjusted in tablet mode. The power button is tiny slit of a button located on the left edge of the laptop, I prefer a slightly bigger button on top near the keyboard but they probably located it on the side for the tablet mode as well. Perhaps I’m nitpicking, but the button feels kind of cheap, reminds me of something you’d find on an old Walkman. It does have a light on it so you can tell if the power is on or not. 

Usability and performance:
One of my favorite features on this laptop is the facial recognition camera. It logs you into Windows automatically, even in a dark room. If you don’t like this, a normal password can also be used. Most of the time (9 out of 10), it recognized me right away; it occasionally asked me to move forward or backward. The tablet feature is neat, although I’m not sure I would use this functionality often. As a laptop, the 3lb weight is acceptable and fairly lightweight. As a tablet, 3lbs is on the heavy side. The “tent mode” is useful to watch videos. 

The Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon graphics is speedy and adequate for most needs. Booting up and launching applications are very quick. Normal usage, such as Word processing, spreadsheets, internet surfing, watching videos etc, the Envy is more than capable for. My son tried teaching me how to play “Fortnite”, it worked, I got a respectable 30-40fps but the graphics wasn’t very detailed. Fortnite auto-selected “Medium” on all the graphics settings for me. The left side of the laptop, where the vents are got hot and the fan kicked into high. 

Conclusion:
Overall, I found this laptop to be very impressive. From the aesthetics to the solid performance, this is an excellent laptop. Usually I would list out “Pro’s and con’s”, with this laptop, I don’t have any “con’s” that I came across. Sure, it would be nice of the keyboard lights dimmed, or the light didn’t spill out from under the keys on an angle, but these aren’t really big issues, to me anyway. I think I found my daily use laptop! I’ve even recommended it to a family member who was shopping for a new laptop!","2","0"

Going into this test, I had a pre-conceived notion of unpleasant things experienced about HP computers. For this reason of prior disappointments, I had no second thoughts about testing this model - I wanted HP to show me what they were made of!

I want to say this LOUDLY and CLEARLY - this is ONE OF THE BEST LAPTOPS I've ever used for activities that do not include video editing or game play.

This is hands down my favorite laptop ever when it comes to daily use and to do things that don't require loads of ram or processor cores to pull off the activity.

VERSATILE - this laptop is right-sized - it is so portable, yet it also allows you to convert to a tablet in either portrait or landscape mode - ideal for certain activities like playing videos. 

FAST - with the SSD this is blazing fast at boot up and shut down - other activities are also helped - it is surprising how quickly the SSD is consumed once adding programs like I use in web design. I'll store the data elsewhere off the SSD in a more robust storage arrangement, but this unit is delicious to use in its responsiveness.

TRACKPAD HEAVEN - while it took some getting used to about the larger than usual trackpad, the fact that it responds to right clicks and left clicks like a real quality laptop used to (much better than my ASUS or ACER units I have in my office). I no longer feel the desire to need a mouse to bypass a horrible trackpad.

KEYBOARD - nice big buttons - back lit so well you can see what the keys say! Nice touch and precious little keyboard flex. Very solid.

THE SCREEN - true HD - am now addicted to watching movies on this - crystal clear - nice color - pretty decent contrast - and it is a touchscreen! This unit is sweet!

QUALITY - this is not a very expensive unit so the attention to detail on assembly and materials is first rate. I don't know if this is plastic or metal in construction (feels and looks like metal), but this is one unit that won't embarrass you in using. And that chocolate grey finish is very premium in execution.

ARE THOSE REAL SPEAKERS? For once there is a laptop on a budget that produces nice sound that won't have you running for earphones. This has a Bang & Olufsen audio system and it is very good for the price - this is not a high performance machine, but these speakers do the computer justice nonetheless.

CONCLUSION - I've been using computers since the days of fortran - I've never liked a computer this much - it is not a high performance diva - it is a solid do most things well product that won't disappoint. One of my colleagues bought a computer built by the fruit company that cost well over $1299 and was light and small like this - but hers looked like a toy compared to this.

HP - you've done yourself proud with this high quality, light, versatile, and fast computer. This is a joy to use and now has become my go to unit for most things.

You can buy a faster machine - you can buy one with more ram - you can buy one for more money or a bigger machine - but this might just be the best all around laptop on the market for under $1k. You also get two usb ports, a usb c, a microsd slot, and a battery that seems to give better than average charge life. The unit does not overheat. It is well balanced and made me a believer in HP being able to built superb computers.","3","1"

The speakers are better than expected as I play my videos/music. Easily connected to bluetooth speakers if you want another option. Very easy to type on and navigate on which is very important for me as a college student. Everything seems to move quickly for the most part, there is minimal delay on some programs. Battery life seems okay--it charges quickly and has lasted me about 8 hours with continuous use. I had a little trouble with all of the predetermined apps & programs--most of which I don't use but over time I was able to get the start menu/task bar/desktop with the appropriate programs I wanted. The font seems a little small and when I went to change it the settings said it wasn't recommended to change them? You can just pinch your fingers on the screen to zoom in so the font grows so it isn't a big deal but I'm not used to having to adjust that so often. I'm a 27yo college student so I'm not sure someone with poor eyesight would enjoy that much. There is no 10 keypad to the right, something to consider if numbers are important to you on your laptop. Very easy set up to begin with Siri-like voice command to help. Easy connection to Wi-Fi, downloading programs. It seemed to heat up pretty quickly but there are various settings with the fan to help with this I saw. The camera IS NOT the quality it showed in store. The pictures it showed in the gallery in Best Buy don't look at all like the pictures you can actually take. There were all these beautiful clear high quality pictures shown but I think you'd be hard-pressed to take a good pic on this (only front facing). The sensitivity of the screen is amazing! You can just lightly touch in the general area & get what you want--not in a bad way. No lag switching between laptop mode & tablet mode. I'm not used to the Microsoft app store but it is easy enough to navigate. Handy tips & notifications available or you can turn off if you desire. I feel a little concerned about the memory on this computer but I chose speed over memory and you can always backup your documents instead. This is a great 2in1 for college because the ability to carry it around, type easily, download items quickly, etc. I really like it so far!","5","0"
"563","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash Silver","Lightweight mobile-friendly design!","Orion","5","I’ve been using the HP Envy X360 for just about a week now and have been very happy with the overall performance and design.
The laptop looks great with a dark ashy grey color and slim body. To me, the color almost looks like a very dark purple in some light. There is a damascus steel styled edge that gives a nice little touch adding to the premium look and feel of the laptop.
I really like the size and feel of the keyboard, the keys almost feel mechanical, although not quite, and having the backlit keyboard is great. Typing on this keyboard is a breeze. The trackpad is wider than a lot of other laptops and the right and left click on the pad work like they do on a mouse. I like the wider trackpad and feel like it makes it easier to navigate the screen.

I’m very happy with the display on this laptop. I love having the touch-screen ability and take full advantage of it when utilizing various apps and programs. The picture on this display is great, HD content is very sharp and the colors are vibrant and crisp. I’ve streamed videos and movies from VUDU, Netflix and Youtube without any issues. The speakers sound really nice too with B&O supplying the audio system, however connecting to a larger speaker via bluetooth is always an option. The bluetooth has been very quick to connect to multiple devices without any problems.

The performance for me has been perfect. I’ve run multiple windows and task simultaneously, and haven’t run into any major performance issues. I have not tried any gaming and probably won’t, beyond what’s available in the app store. I don’t think the specs are quite good enough for any big games or for doing much video editing, but this computer is perfect for just about anything else. I really think having a solid state drive makes a big difference and helps the laptop to boot up and run quickly and smoothly. The SSD is on the lower side with only 128gb however there is a micro SD card slot that you can take advantage of for storing your files.
The laptop comes with a two piece standard wall charging cord but you can also charge it using a USB-C cable. Having the USB-C port available for charging adds a lot of versatility and gives you more mobility since you won’t have to lug around the long, heavy-duty power cable. There is no HDMI port on this laptop so you will need to buy a USB-C to HDMI adapter if that’s something you need.
I think this is a very nice everyday use laptop that is very mobile friendly with it’s lightweight design, USB-C charging and touch-screen display. I love the design and feel of the keyboard as well as the display and the audio system sounds better than most. I would definitely recommend this laptop to friends.","1","0"

It feels nice to the touch and the finishing is grippy enough that it doesn't slip while holding in one hand.

Setup was as with most windows computers. I followed the prompts and signed in with my Microsoft account. As always, I ran for updates first (after getting my favorite browser extensions loaded). After those ran their course, the first thing that I noticed is how fast this computer is. I was pleasantly surprised. We have an older desktop and my work computer that are not the fastest. Solid State is the way to go. Everything loads quickly and just as importantly, works quickly while you're using it. People forget about that. Also, it loads fast. I think from pushing the power button to seeing the home screen is 10 seconds.

This is my first 2 in 1. I have a touchscreen laptop and a tablet with an attachable keyboard. This is not my preferred format. The keyboard is better than the detachable one, which I actually quite like. This is just better. Flipping around to tablet mode brings the prompt from windows to go into tablet mode. You can choose to have it change to tablet mode automatically or for windows to keep asking.

If I have anything to complain about, it's the clarity of the screen. I thought that 1080 on this screen would be sharper than it is. In most use, it's actually clear enough. It's mostly with text that I feel that I would like a bit more sharpness. But with that said, for the price I would get this model again with the screen that it has.

Battery life has been great and the charging time are faster that I would have thought. I haven't been without it when I needed it yet, and I have not used it while charging. Since it loads so fast, I've actually been turning it off rather than letting it hibernate or go into standby mode as I would with many other laptops. That has also saved a lot of battery.

Overall, I really like this and even though I complained about the screen, it has replaced my higher resolution tablet and laptop. The size is great and it's so nice to work on something so fast. I hope that it maintains its speed as my other solid state computer has. Highly recommended.","1","0"

A dark ash case coupled with a slim profile creates a design that is elegant and easy to handle. Despite it’s thin contour, it is still balanced with enough heft to provide sturdiness whether using it as a laptop or tablet. It never feels bulky, yet the durable hinges imbue a sense of quality that is found throughout the components of this compact machine.

As someone who relies on my devices for multi-tasking, editing, and presenting, there are a few features that stand out to me. First is the incredibly tactile, backlit keyboard. It has everything I need to quickly navigate. It is coupled with the extra wide keypad, so I still haven’t needed to connect a mouse yet, which is typically my first step when using a laptop. Finally, the 16:9 screen with this high resolution gives me plenty of space to open multiple tabs and do side by side editing. The gorgeous black bezel gives the illusion of a bigger screen and creates a polished look if I open this up with clients. 

Wish the device activated automatically when I opened the screen, but pressing a quick button and then having the camera recognize and log me in is a time saver that is much appreciated. The built-in speakers don’t blow me away, but are more than sufficient for playing internet videos and listening to music as I create presentations and marketing materials. The processing speed is also zippy and keeps up with my photo and video editing needs, both through installed software and cloud based applications. Unlike my previous device, this one will run all day on a single battery charge, leaving me untethered and free to work wherever is convenient.

Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the quality and efficiency of this solid laptop. I’m not an expert on the most up-to-date specs and internal components, but my husband is meticulous at researching all that. So far this gift from him has been more than sufficient for every task I’ve thrown at it.","2","0"

 First off, it's an HP. That alone should be the first warning sign. HP uses the worst and cheapest components available, so you're looking right off at a machine which is essentially disposable, the Bic lighter of computers. The AMD processor is slow, weak, generates excessive heat, lacks the power to multi-task, draws on too much of the disk...I know a computer isn't any good when it uses--consistently--upwards of fifty percent of the processor and, also consistently, seventy-five percent of the disk just in normal operations.

 The computer comes with HP's usual amount of bloatware, and, even if you try to uninstall the McAfee suite and replace it with other anti-virus and security software, most of it cannot be removed. As well, the HP specific bloatware is apparently non-removable. This further serves to slow the machine down.

 It runs Windows 10. Microsoft hasn't released a decent OS since Win98. Those built on the NT platform are pretty poor, and 10 is no exception. 10 takes a long time to boot with a fast processor, and is practically running backwards with the AMD on this computer. The processor slowness combined with the slowness of the software makes for a frustrating time in using this machine.

 Positive comment: It isn't expensive, so you get what you pay for--a cheap, semi-functional laptop to use as a stopgap until you can afford something better and faster.

 Do yourself a favor and pass this one by.","13","6"

I anticipated I would probably need to upgrade the 4MB ram to 8 or 16, but, I'm not sure anything can help this beast. Occasionally it will dip to a reasonable CPU, but in general it sits about 85%+ when any explorer is launched. Even after uninstalling just about every process that eats CPU, memory and disk, it's still unusable and slow. Perhaps this product is best suited for someone who rarely connects to the internet such as a poet or someone's grandma looking for a better display for playing baccarat. I'm holding out hope that perhaps it was dropped at some point while being delivered to the store and there is inherently an issue with the hardware, but I'm not taking my risk on another ""deal"" - when I croak I will remember how I could have had an extra day of my life back if not for this laptop.","2","0"

The HP Envy 2 in 1 was super easy to setup. Unpacking and setup took about 10 minutes. Windows 10 with Cortana narration makes going through the steps of setup and sign-in simple. I was greeted with HP’s Jump Start program during my first sign on. Jump Start will guide you through product registration, McAfee Anti-Virus sign up, and other paperwork like items. There is also an HP Support Assistant that will handle items such as driver updates, firmware updates, and allows access to a lot of technical information about the laptop. This tool is also a very easy way to access the laptop’s serial number and model number. Both numbers are printed on the bottom of the laptop, but you won’t be able to read it without a magnifying glass. Having this information available through HP Support Assistant will come in very handy when you interact with HP for support services. 

Microsoft Word signed me into my Office 365 account and verified and instantly registered Office on my new laptop. Within minutes, all of my office applications were available to me. Windows took care of syncing my shortcuts between my different Windows 10 system. Synced my desktop settings such as my desktop background. One Drive and Windows 10 email took a few minutes to setup. Windows Update also went very smooth.

Look and Feel:

This laptop has an excellent feel to it. It feels solid to the touch. The laptop is thin. It is heavy at 4.7 pounds. It is not so heavy that it prevents me from throwing this in a backpack or computer bag to work on the go. The unique hinge design allows the laptop to fold in half so that I can use it as a tablet. The hinges are made of metal. I do not have any worries about the laptop joints being week and breaking with use. 

Microsoft has done a great job on the tablet experience. The screen supports both touch and Windows Ink. Meaning, I can use a Windows Ink enabled pen to draw, write, and paint on the screen. I can also use the pen as a mouse in many applications. My Microsoft Surface Pen synced with this laptop with no issues. Writing was smooth. Input lag was minimal if any at all.

Probably my favorite part of the look and feel are the two AMD badges on the wrist wrest. It is so refreshing to finally have something other than an Intel logo on a laptop. It is a small thing but it did make me happy to see them.

Screen:

The screen is pretty good. The screen resolution is 1080p. Not as high resolution as a Microsoft Surface and certainly not in the same league as a Mac Book. But, the screen is adequately bright and vibrant enough for most uses. I played a few videos on Netflix. The motion was clean with some occasional stutter and pixilation. But nothing unlike what I see on an expensive LED TV. The AMD Settings application does give me the ability to adjust the video experience by giving you access to multiple video presets such as Cinema, Vivid, and Home Video. It also gives you the ability to custom tailor your experience by giving you access to all the settings controls. 

Working through office applications was easy. The screen responded to pinching, zooming, and navigation commands without hesitation. Scaling is also spot on. Images and text were clear regardless of the zoom level. Images were sharp and colorful. The screen provides an acceptable and pleasant computing experience. 

The laptop screen is FreeSync enabled. This means that the integrated Vega 8 graphics processor can squeeze better frame rates and performance out of the screen than it could without the technology. By default, FreeSync is not enabled. I have no idea why. You will need to go into the AMD Settings application to turn it on. The laptop is not a gaming platform. It will play games from the Windows Store with ease. I tested using Halo Spartan Assault. The graphics were butter smooth. Response between my Xbox controller and the laptop were also very quick. I was limited to what I could test due to the limited size hard drive on this system. Then again, I didn’t pick up this laptop to game on. 

Performance:

Performance out of box has been very good. I have not seen any slow-downs working with Windows or Windows applications. Multi-tasking has been excellent. My only gripe is the performance of Microsoft’s Edge browser; which stinks on every computer I have used. This is not an issue unique to HP or AMD. 

My primary use for this computer is Microsoft Office, web browsing, and lite entertainment. Microsoft Office applications start quickly and without any issues. The computer does keep up with my typing without any pausing or keystroke buffering. Spreadsheets load quickly. I have had no issues manipulating data or working with pivot tables. Microsoft OneNote, which I do use extensively, does not hesitate when jumping between notebooks, typing pages of data, drawing, manipulating images, or importing content from the web. Overall, I would say this notebook rocks when it comes to productivity!

For lite entertainment, I do watch the occasional Netflix movie. I was able to work through multiple OneNote notebooks while streaming a Netflix movie. The movie video played without any interruptions. There was no stuttering or artifacts that I could detect. OneNote did not give me any issues either. Having other applications open and minimized did not seem to have an impact on performance either. I did spend some time watching CPU and memory performance in Task Manager. Ryzen ate through whatever I threw at it. It was a real treat to see a laptop with eight threads all churning through work. The 8 GB of memory also seemed to be more than adequate for my needs. 

Touchpad and keyboard:

The keyboard feels comfortable. The keyboard does include a full number pad. The over-sized touchpad is off center, favoring the left side of the keyboard, and is comfortably located under the space bar. Everything is offset due to the inclusion of the number pad. The keys are a comfortable size, have a good travel, and are relatively quiet. You will not be keeping anyone awake typing on this keyboard unless you are one of those people who really pound your way through a document. 

The keyboard keys are backlit. I work at my computer under multiple lighting conditions. Backlighting solves all the issues I have associated with workspace lighting. The keys and keyboard are evenly lit. Each key’s value is easy to read. No one key looks brighter than any other key. Finally, there are no bright spots bleeding between the keys. This makes the keyboard’s lighting easy on the eyes.

The touchpad can make a break a notebook. I have had issues with laptops, name your manufacturer, where the typing experience is ruined by the cursor jumping around the screen while typing. This does lead to content being auto deleted while typing, text being injected into parts of the document where I did not intend it to go, and sometimes the mouse choosing items off the ribbon in MS Word and causing some random feature being activated. Most people will tell you to lift your wrists when typing. It is not a wrist issue. It is an issue with the touch pad. HP and Synaptics seem to have nailed the drives on this model. I’ve written this entire review without a single typing incident. Thank you both for fixing this! 

There are some issues still with the touchpad. For example, if I am on a media rich web page, the finger gestures may stutter or not work at all. The good news if that these issues do not extend to the touch screen. If I am having an issue scrolling down a web page with the touchpad then I can perform the same activity directly on the touch screen with little to no issues. If I had to choose between the typing experience and web surfing performance, I will choose the typing experience. 

Sound:

Bang & Olufsen have done a remarkable job in the world of laptops. The sound is not deep and rich by any measure. All speaker laptops are similarly constrained. However B&O have done a great job of making their laptop solution clear at all volume levels. The sound is not tinny. The laptop and speakers do not resonate when the speakers are at volume. For laptops speakers, these are excellent! 

Misc:

I was able to connect to multiple Bluetooth enabled devices including my office’s stereo receiver to stream Pandora while I worked. I also connected to a portable Sony speaker, another HP Laptop, wireless headphones, and a smart TV. I tried to connect to a Microsoft Xbox Controller but was not able to do it with the one controller I have. I am unsure if it was an issue with the controller or the laptop. The controller connected via USB cable without any issues. I enjoyed an hour of Halo Spartan Assault with the controller without any further issues.

Overall Impressions:

I think HP has a home run with this laptop. The build quality, the system specs, and the laptop’s performance are outstanding at this price point. Multi-tasking is superb. I really love that HP took a chance on the new Ryzen APU. AMD has come a long way over the last few years and this mobile processor shows that AMD can stand toe to toe with Intel.

I did add a second monitor to this laptop via HDMI cable. Video is clear, bright, colorful, and smooth. The sound is great for a laptop. I can easily connect, via Bluetooth, to external devices to stream content. I am very thankful that my workflow is no longer interrupted by garbage touch pad issues thanks to improved driver support from Synaptic. The HP Support Assistant software is very useful. System specs, help documents, interactive help, and warranty information are a few clicks away where they used to be a painful phone call to support. 

This is a great laptop and I hope to get years of excellent use from it.","11","0"

HP must have listened to feedback, because the HDD is gone! Sure, this version comes with a 128 GB SSD, but I’ll take a low capacity SSD over a large HDD any day. The smaller capacity drive could be an issue for some people. After removing unwanted software and running updates, I only have a little over 54 GB of free space on the drive. If you work primarily in the cloud you’ll be fine, otherwise I would recommend swapping out the stock drive for something bigger or keep an external drive with you for work/school.

The Ryzen 5 2500U with mobile Vega 8 completely crushes Intel’s integrated graphics. You’re still going to want to pick up a laptop with dedicated graphics (with at least a GTX 1050) if you want to do any real gaming. For light gaming, this is a decent option if you keep your expectations in check. I don’t play too many games, but here are the results from the games I currently play:
 -- Fortnite: mid-30s FPS at 1080p with medium settings
 -- Skyrim Special Edition (no mods): mid-40s FPS at 720p with low settings
 -- Guild Wars 2 (PoF): high-20s to low-30s FPS at 720p with low-medium settings
 -- Hearthstone: runs flawlessly at max settings

What’s the point of a 2-in-1 if you don’t actually use tablet mode? Paired with a decent Bluetooth stylus (I’m using a Wacom stylus), I love using the Envy in “tablet” mode, but only when it’s sitting on a desk/table. A 2-in-1 this large does not make for a very comfortable tablet experience if you just plan to hold it for long periods of time. If you keep it to a table/desk/lap/whatever, then it’s great! The touchscreen is very responsive. I have sworn off buying paper notebooks, everything goes into MS OneNote. If you’re a student, and don’t mind a larger laptop, the Envy x360 paired with a stylus will help keep your notes clean and organized.

The speakers are pretty good for a laptop, but I would still recommend using headphones if you’re watching videos or playing games. They can get pretty loud before you start getting sound distortion. I prefer to use the speakers when I’m making Skype calls with my family. Speaking of the Skype, the webcam can just “okay” (I’ve never been impressed with laptop webcams).

Battery life is pretty good for a laptop of this size. While HP claims you can get up to 10 hours, I’m not getting that amount from my usage. I’m getting around 7 hours with the screen brightness around 50%, I usually have a bluetooth mouse connected, and listen to streaming music with headphones. Your mileage will vary. What makes the battery a positive of the laptop is how quickly it charges. I was able to go from 20% to full in a little over an hour.

** The Bad **
The screen does not get as bright as I would like. This was a pretty common complaint from last year’s Envy, so it’s a bummer that it wasn’t addressed for the 2018 Envy. Images, movies, games, and colors still look pretty good for “only 1080p”, but you might not want to work near a window on a sunny day.

The trackpad, while responsive, feels rather small for a 15” laptop. There feels like a lot of wasted space below the keyboard that could be used for a much larger trackpad. HP still uses Synaptics drivers, but that doesn’t bug me enough to be a deal-breaker.

** Conclusion **
This is a really solid choice for a mid-range laptop for productivity. Don’t let the Radeon Vega sticker fool you, this isn’t a true gaming laptop, but you will be able to play more casual games compared to Intel’s integrated graphics on similar priced laptops. Even though this is a mid-range laptop, it looks and feels like a much more expensive laptop than it really is, thanks to its all aluminum build and really excellent keyboard. The touchscreen is very responsive and Windows Ink works great if you want to draw or keep all your notes organized in the cloud. With the smaller drive, working in the cloud will be ideal unless you want to carry around an extral drive or swap out the current 128 GB SSD.","4","0"

Like with any HP Envy, this 2 in 1 is almost ready to use right out of the box. The initial setup only takes a few minutes. 
In my opinion, I believe that the HP Envy with the AMD Ryzen 5 processor is for the on the go user; student, people that work on the road or for the people that are new to acclimating to the 2 in 1 laptop environment. If this is your first time using a 2 in 1 then there’s nothing to feel intimidated about. In fact, I believe that you will quickly adjust and eventually wonder how you managed to get along without it. 
Each time you open the laptop, you’re going to be amazed at how fast it ‘wakes up’ and uses your face to gain excess to your profile. If facial recognition isn’t your thing then you can still use a password or create a PIN code. 
In laptop form, the Envy will do what you could always do with a laptop. I think the user will enjoy using the touch screen to gain immediate access to whatever link or tab instead of using the touchpad. The touchpad is responsive but I found myself having to go into the settings to lower the sensitivity because when I typed, the cursor would move to a different area of the paragraph when lightly touched. However, I do wish that HP would update their Number Lock button so that the user would know as to whether or not the num lock was on or off much like the Caps Lock key. 
Where I found the Ryzen 5 processor to be faster was when I would open the Xbox game app from the tiles menu. Compared to the Intel core i7 8th Gen, the Ryzen 5 was several seconds faster. You can stream games from your Xbox One to your Envy but there is some visual quality lost when doing this but at the same time, this eliminates the player’s need to occupy a television that someone else might want to use. What about if you want to use the Envy for gaming directly from the laptop? Unfortunately, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop, this isn’t the device to satisfy that desire. A lot of the System Requirements for games like State of Decay 2, Shadow Of War etc fell short for what was necessary for those games. That’s not to say that you can’t play games on the Envy but you will have to be aware of what games will push the processor to its limits without compromising an enjoyable experience.
The Envy in tablet form provides a beautiful 1080 resolution viewing experience when watching Netflix, HBO, a movie from your iTunes collection or any preferred streaming service. The 15-inch screen is definitely accommodating when it comes to enjoying entertainment. As I mentioned before, the touchscreen is responsive for those moments when you might need to pause quick. Also, in tablet form, the Envy allows an accessible option for digital artists or notetakers that want to use an Active Pen or Passive Stylist on the touchscreen. It’s pretty amazing when you realize all the options that a 2 in 1 really has to offer. 
To some, the 128GB Solid State Drive might be low in 2018 but I see this as an affordable option for those middle of the road users that are seeking a solid computing experience without excessive power and a ton of memory that would be wasted on them.
Hewlett Packard knows how to make gorgeous 2 in 1 laptops. The sharply backlit keyboard, the compact and slim design is always a sight to behold.","1","0"

The Ryzen 5 2600U is AMD's new high-end mobile processor running 4 cores and 8 threads. For years, AMD has not been competitive in this particular market, but the Ryzen 5 packs a punch. Add in the Vega 8 GPU, which clocks up to 1100 MHz, and things get very interesting fast. Speed and fluidity are impressive.

During initial setup, Cortana can walk you through via voice prompts (and responding to your verbal answers), or you can click buttons if you prefer. I did a mix of both, and both input methods worked great. You're also prompted to set up facial recognition, which works pretty well on this computer thanks to the Windows Hello front camera setup. 

Once you sign into your Windows account and get everything setup, the computer hums along very nicely. The only glitch I noticed was that it got particularly hot on the left side during setup. The fan was somewhat noisy and began running as soon as I powered the computer on for the first time and stayed on until I was done with setup. However, after setup, it was fine. I wonder if there's an issue with the setup script that causes the fan to run at high speed until setup is done.

Of course, it has some bloatware on it. The first thing to get rid of - as always - is McAffee. For the love of all that is good, I'm begging manufacturers to stop putting that junk on computers. Anyway, it uninstalls pretty easily, and then you can install a better functioning anti-virus program of your choosing. 

One piece of bloatware you may want to hold onto, though, is 25 GB storage free for one year from Dropbox.  And having Netflix pre-installed isn't such a bad thing.

The design looks and feels good. It has a nice industrial look to it. Materials seem first-rate. I tried torquing the keyboard, and there were no noticeable squeaks. The hinge allows the screen to rotate into tablet mode but holds the screen steady while using it as a laptop. I've tried some touchscreens that wobble far too much; this one does not. It seemed as firmly held in place as a regular laptop.

It comes with a 15.5-inch 1080p touchscreen that looks pretty good, but not as good as some of the high-end screens we see on more expensive laptops these days. Then again, this one is not super expensive, and the 1080p screen looks fine. Touch controls have worked seamlessly for me.

It comes with the Bang & Olufsen speaker grill running the width of the computer across the top of the keys. It looks kind of cool and sounds a bit better than many other laptops. Granted, this is no B&O audiophile experience, but it's good for laptop speakers. 

Battery life is rated at 10+ hours, which isn't bad at all for this size of screen and is a significant improvement over prior models. 

The integrated AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics chipset functions better than anything you're likely to find short of a dedicated graphics card. The Vega 8 processor really helps matters here, as it is dramatically faster than it's Intel counterparts. 

This particular model also has a nice 128GB SSD. 

There are a decent number of ports: 2 USB 3.0 Type A ports, 1 USB-C 3.1 port, 1 HDMI output, and a media card reader. Unfortunately, it uses a proprietary charger rather than charging by USB-C. 

Of course, at 15.5 inches, this is not a portable as smaller laptops. If you primarily want to use this as a desktop replacement with perhaps some light to moderate gaming, it's a great fit. If it will have to travel everywhere you go, I might suggest a 13-inch screen, instead. But as long as you know that going it, I think you'll be pleased.

With a slick, industrial design vibe, solid construction, and a killer processor with terrific onboard graphics, what's not to like? Well, it'd be nice to have a 4k display, larger SSD (that is an option on different models), and charge via USB-C. But those are really minor gripes - especially at this price point. 

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this computer. ","5","0"
"585","HP - ENVY 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash","HP Delivers the Goods","HarvickFan","4","Unobxing the laptop you can really feel the quality of the build design. The finish is gorgeous, what they call Dark Ash, almost like a slate grey. It’s pretty thin for this range of laptop, but not so thin you’ll be blown away. But you can really see how they spent time on the fit and finish of this one. It does weigh just under 5lbs which isn’t too heavy, at least by my standards, but not the lightest out there either. But accept some extra weight since this is a 15” display with 3 cell battery that should give up to 11 hours of life on a charge. It also has a hinged design to allow the laptop to convert to a touch screen tablet. The hinges seem very solid, made of metal, and should withstand years of use.

Setup was very easy. It runs Windows 10 of course, but this was my first laptop that walked me through initial setup using the Cortana voice interaction process. It was awesome. Cortana asks you a question, and you answer her, simple as that. After a few mins, and any necessary software or driver updates, you’re all set. I was blown away by the Cortana setup and how intuitive it was, and how accurate. If you’ve used Windows 10 you know what to expect from that so I won’t give any further review of the software, however the laptop does come with some neat integrations, like the HP support assistant. There is also a fair share of bloatware as well, but Windows 10 makes uninstalling all of the programs you don’t want or need a breeze.

The display is very good, not amazing, but for this range of laptop its a great screen. Full 1080p HD with touch screen capability. The colors were very good and pretty accurate. The brightness was pretty good, although I do wish it did get a just a tick brighter, especially when using this outdoors. While this isn’t a gaming laptop, games looked very clear and crisp and using desktop software and browsing the web, the display doesn’t miss a beat. The touch screen works incredibly well. Very responsive. There is also an AMD settings section that allows you custom tailor the screen and its performance. It also has a full size HDMI output to allow you to run an external monitor and it works great.

Performance is very solid. The Ryzen 5 chip seems to up to the challenge for anything you can throw at it. It also allows you to custom configure the thermal profile of the laptop, depending on the application or workflow you are using. You can set it to run cool, which will slow down overall performance; or you can set it to max performance with increased cooling and fans running to squeeze out the most capability possible – and a few other settings in between. I’ve tried them all and they seem to work great, and for the most part I leave mine set to the auto balance mode, which allows the computer to decide which performance profile to use based on what I’m doing at the time. The one area of performance that I wish was a little better was the wifi networking card. While I can maintain full 866.7 speed connections to my router, the actual download/upload speeds of the laptop can be inconsistent, or slightly below what I see on my other hardware around my house. I’ve played around with some settings to try and get a little better performance, but so far no luck. I’ll keep trying, but I’m using 1GB Comcast Xfinity service, and this laptop underperforms other computers in our home on wifi in the same location by 100-200 Mbps download.

I love the backlit keyboard here primarily because of the full size number pad. The keys feel tight and responsive and give that satisfying travel and click feedback as you type. The touch pad is also very nice, gives accurate feedback to finger gestures and also has a very nice click feedback on use. it’s also a great size, not too small and not too large. It also has Bang & Olufsen audio via stereo speakers. While the audio is not going to blow you away, for a laptop the audio is very good. Watching videos or playing games sounds great when using the built in audio, and you also have a headphone jack for wired listening too. 

Overall this laptop is a feature rich powerhouse that for most people will be more than enough for their computing needs. The fit and finish is outstanding, similar to laptops much more expensive, and the performance does not disappoint.","1","0"
"586","HP - ENVY 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash","Good performance, value for the money","Shail","4","This is my first laptop with an AMD processor and to be honest, I was a little skeptical. But after using it for few weeks, I can say that Ryzen 5 is as good as Intel Core 5 series. I do not use this laptop for gaming, so I don't know how will it hold against graphics intensive games. Here are my key observations:

* Setup *
The setup was extremely easy as usually is the case with most of new laptops and desktops now a days. The Cortana assistant walked me through the setup process and you have a choice to use either your voice or keyboard to choose various options. I, personally, prefer keyboard over voice but I tried few options with voice and Cortana responded without any issues. I turned on ""Face Recognition"" feature (part of Windows Hello app) and it has been able to recognize my face in various light conditions. It doesn't work well in very low-light situations. The usual bloatware is still there. I removed McAfee anti-virus and installed available software and OS updates. I think the whole process took me somewhere 15-30 mins.

* Screen *
The max screen resolution is 1080p. I would say that the screen is somewhere between average and good. If you consider the price point, I tend to think that it's on the ""good"" end. I have tried it in multiple light conditions and have been able to work comfortably. I haven't tried it outside in the sunlight so not sure how will it hold up against that.

* Keyboard *
This laptop has a dedicated number pad on the right. That is why the keyboard is a bit off center. As I use number pad a lot, personally I like it. But this is really a matter of personal preference. Otherwise, the keyboard is great. It has backlight, the keys are big enough and does not create too much noise when pressed.

* Sound *
The B&O speakers are decent. I usually have music playing in the background while I am working and these speakers provide good sound. I usually play them at 50% audio level. I tried them at the max volume for a shorter period of time and didn't find any distortion.

* Tablet Mode *
At 15.5"", I think it is a little too big to be used as a tablet. But it is again personal preference as I have used it for watching movies in the tablet mode while traveling on a train. The design (specially the hinges) looks solid. The touch screen is very responsive. I use it with a bluetooth stylus and am very happy with it's performance in the tablet mode.

* Performance *
As I mentioned in the beginning, I mostly use this laptop for work (MS Office, Java coding, running app servers etc). For these purposes, it has been an excellent performer. I am able to work on multiple applications at the same time without any lags/delays etc. The fan on this one seems to run more frequently than my older laptop which is a little bit annoying. A full reboot take around 20 seconds while waking up from sleep is almost instantaneous. This is primarily thanks to 128 GB SSD. Talking about SSDs, some people might find 128GB to be on the lower side. As I have my personal cloud storage and I use that for most of my needs, 128 GB is more than enough for me. It would have been good if there was an option for 256 or 512 GB SSD.

* Conclusion *
A solid laptop for the price range. The design looks and feels like a much more expansive laptop. The touchscreen is responsive and works great. As the storage is limited to 128 GB, working in the cloud will be ideal. It would have been great if it had a USB-C type charger but that's a minor gripe.","1","0"
"587","HP - ENVY 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash","Performance beyond it's price point","Benz","5","I've been using this laptop for various applications for a few months now and I've been very happy with it. A laptop purchase in this price range is all about the ""bang for the buck"" and this one gets you ahead. AMD has made high performance processors much more affordable with the release of the Ryzen line. Combine that with the integrated Vega 8 graphics and this is a very cost effective high-performing laptop. 

Let's start with performance - The Ryzen 5 processor in this laptop combined with the SSD is seamless and quick. There is almost no wait time whatsoever in application start-up. Web browsing and page loading is very quick. I plan to use this laptop for general applications but I wanted to put it to the test with some gaming. Running Rainbow 6 at full resolution still gave me a very quick game speed of 40 FPS. That is extremely good performance for a laptop at this price point. The Vega 8 GPU comes with integrated Radeon software that allows for very detailed configuration of the display including a VSR function. The screen is also a UWVA panel which is great for movie viewing. This laptop runs surprisingly quiet. I hear no audible throttling even during demanding applications. The Bang&Olufsen sound exceeded my expectations for a laptop this thin. The touch-screen is spot on and has the same super-reactive feel as my iPhone.

Fit and Finish - I'm always picky about this, especially with convertible laptops. They are generally plagued with flimsy hinges and screen-flex. This is not the case with HP Envy 360. The hinges are tight and there is nearly no screen flex. Build quality in general is very good. This laptop feels solid and sturdy beyond it's price point. It's thin and light yet solid. The all aluminum body has a nice matte finish to it. It looks like the light silver versions are Intel based and the AMD based versions are in the dark gray. I find the dark gray far more attractive and sleek looking. The back-lit keyboard has a great feel to it and is also quiet to operate. Key layout is well thought out with lots of easily accessible one-touch functions. There is a good and complete array of ports and I/O's on this laptop. 

Overall I'm very happy with this laptop. You're basically getting a high-end laptop at a mid-level price point. It covers all bases for function and performance. It'll do whatever you need it to. looks and feels great, and didn't break the bank. It has exceeded my expectations. I'd recommend it to a friend.","6","0"
"588","HP - ENVY 2-in-1 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash","Smart design, small but fast SSD","StephenS","5","The bottom line is that I really enjoy this laptop and, with just one caveat, I’d confidently recommend it to almost anyone looking for a general purpose PC.

First, I love the color and the over design aesthetic. The screen hinges are nice and have a patterned swirl that makes it look more stylish and classy than just another 2-in-1 rectangle laptop. I also love the keyboard -- backlighting has become a crucial feature to me and the keys on the keyboard stand out to me as easy to read and as just a real joy to use.

Performance is great in this price range and is really helped along by the small but speedy SSD. I mention “small” because that’s probably the one caveat I would have for recommending this as a general purpose PC. If you live your life almost entirely online and just need a computer as your gateway to the Internet then a 128GB SSD is plenty and you may not even consider it small. If you’re a heavy business, graphic, or technical user who finds yourself frequently hauling around lots of large files (think ISO libraries, virtual machines for demonstrations or cross-OS development, etc.) then 128GB can get uncomfortably cramped real quick. That’s not a fault of the laptop though because you should be aware of the drive size before you buy it, I’m just mentioning it to make sure you’re aware and factor it into your decision. But if you live in the cloud or just otherwise don’t need large amounts of local storage, the 128GB SSD is a great performer that pairs very well with this laptop.

One thing I have long liked about HP computers is the HP Support Assistant for keeping the computer up-to-date with the latest patches. And if you have multiple HP products the HP Assistant can help you keep track of multiple systems -- computers and printers especially. If you’re like me -- the one in the family that everyone else looks to to keep the Internet, tablets, computers, phones, and printers connected and running smoothly -- that multiple device insight from a single computer is a genuine benefit.

So it really comes down to two things -- if you’re not a hardcore gamer, and if you don’t need a lot of local storage, then this is a smartly designed and well thought-out 2-in-1 laptop that should meet your needs very well. For the money I would recommend this easily.","1","0"

So when I tell others whom I know that I only have 11.54 Mbps for the download and 1.01 for the upload (and that is on a ""good"" day!) people really find that hard to believe. On top of that I have my laptops connected wirelessly. This HP laptop Model: 15-BS113DX ""breezes"" through search engines such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge--not only for the written word, but also for music and TV program videos, etc. It has Windows 10 and with this feature you get Cortana. Just enter terms like file explorer (i.e., documents), disk cleanup, settings, control panel, degrag & optimize, weather, THIS PC, sticky notes, calendar, etc., etc. into the Cortana search bar and you'd be amazed at how easy it is to place icons for these and other functions on your lower task bar, desktop saver screen, and START MENU. Quick access to the aforementioned functions and other computer related functions is nice! Another valuable tool is the TASK MANAGER. There are times when I've encountered ""scareware"" which freezes operation of the computer and the message on the screen will direct the user to phone a number for paid assistance and potential compromise of security. With TASK Manager you can restore the control of your computer--without engaging in trying to get ""risky"" assistance. With this laptop, if you go into mouse settings, you can also place the Synaptics Pointing Device icon on your lower task bar so that you can control the functionality of this laptop's touchpad and external mouse--if used. Again, I only have a limited amount of Mbps and most of the time, I ""fly"" from one computer related activity to the next. At first, I did have a slight problem ""fully"" installing all of the Microsoft updates, but all of the updates finally went through. Many times, throughout the day, I will engage in a ""disk cleanup"" to keep things running smoothly and about once per month I will optimize my drives and I will also conduct a FULL Kaspersky Internet security scan. The following are of my choosing; however, it is relatively easy to download programs such as Apache OpenOffice (to type documents, etc.), to download (or set up) your A.I.O. wireless printer, VLC media player (to play your DVD's), etc. I use this laptop a lot during each day and I am very happy with it so far. Thanks, also, to the Geek Squad Tech Support team who I've subscribed to their services for 16 years--beginning this August 2018.","47","29"
"593","HP - 15.6"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i3 - 8GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - HP Finish In Jet Black","Overall Great Laptop","peterburtnett","5","So far, nearly a month into having the computer, I would certainly recommend this laptop. First of all, the display and sound system have really shocked me the most. I am certainly no tech expert, but the sound has deep bass and high treble, and the display has the ability to play 8k footage on YouTube! For a laptop under $500, this was quite surprising. I haven't tested with extreme CPU consuming gameplay, but that is the one area where this laptop struggles slightly. I attempted to play Fortnite, and I was able to play, but for there to be no lag I had to turn the graphics to low or maybe at best medium. However, when graphics were set to Epic, the gameplay did LOOK great, but was clunky at best. 
Overall, the laptop runs pretty smoothly, and only starts to lag when there are several tabs or programs open, but even still performs quite well. The display and sound surprised me, and I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a high quality, budget priced laptop.","14","4"

My only complaint is that with constant streaming it gets 5.25 hours with speakers at 100% and backlight 75%. With headphones that have big speakers at full volume it lasts 4 hrs constant streaming. I have charged and continuiously ran computer five times.

IT PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY - watching Netflix & Amazon Prime streams without a hiccup. I was a bit concerned about it 'only' being a i3 CPU, so I popped in a Samsung 860 EVO SSD immediately after first power up, performed data migration, then a fresh Windows install after the 'big' April update corrupted during installation. Results are a five second boot time from hitting the power button. The 'clean' Windows install eliminated all of the HP 'bloat-ware', and the HDD/SSD swap took about 15 minutes after looking at HP's maintenance guide.

Most affordable laptops have junk software pre-installed that will keep showing you offers.
The first thing I did was skip the free trial of their virus checker and install a free avg software, Next I went into the control panel and uninstalled any software that I wasn't interested in (e.g. games).

Additionally, during proof reading, incidental touches move the cursor. I'm not a big fan of win10 but I'm getting used to it. Some of the ramp up in CPU usage is linked to the operating system. It's difficult to separate the OS from the machine. The keyboard is laid out with nice spacing. The mouse pad isn't overly sensitive, I like that.

"603","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 12.5"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Iron Gray","Average. Extremely average.","Paul","3","I purchased this because I wanted something extremely portable to casually browse on and occasionally do homework. For the average person, I think this is a perfectly fine computer, though I expected a bit more from an i5 and 8gb of ram, even if it is only a dual core. Perhaps the storage is slow, I’m unsure, but it is never really in a hurry to get things done.

The display is rather dim, though quite sharp at 1080p in only 12.5 diagonal. It’s 16:9 aspect ratio makes it a bit awkward for tablet use, so I don’t really recommend it if that is a selling point for you. 

Speakers are bottom firing, and slightly above average for a notebook of this size.

Battery life is quite decent for such a small and portable unit. The included charger is a pin/barrel type, and I had hoped that it would be able to take a charge from the single USB C port, however it cannot, leaving you with the factory barrel style charger as your only option. For someone who looks for portability, having a single charger to use on both your phone/notebook/tablet is a nice bonus. This however is not the case with this unit.

I purchased this on sale at $499, and at that price it’s probably worth the money if you want portability and MUST have Windows. At full price I would not recommend this. I’d rather someone look into the Surface Go (yes, even the base model at $399), which is what I ended up returning this for.","1","0"

When it did work it would only last and hour or so. I hadn't started using it full time for work yet so I kind of let it go. 2 months later I decided to dig into the problem and thought I would just start over with a different brand mouse. I bought a Logitech bluetooth mouse and same exact problem. With both, it was hard to even get them to connect. Contacted Lenovo and went through a few software steps to no avail. They then transferred me to a senior tech that informed me that moving forward it would not be covered under warranty. The laptop was just over 90 days old. So I paid the one time fee ($79.99) to fix it. (So much for the 1 year warranty) They transferred me to a tech who trouble shot the same things as the tech before and eventually had me restore the whole windows system. So I paid that money for a tech to tell me to restore my system and gave me a case number and said to call them back if that didn't work. Well, guess what it worked for about an hour after the restore and I'm right back where i started. And yes, a bluetooth speaker worked just fine, just not a mouse. So I'm stuck with a laptop for another 4-5 years without a working mouse. I should have stuck with Samsung.....Never again Lenovo....","5","2"
"606","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 12.5"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Iron Gray","Will be exchanging it for the 2nd time tomorrow...","NicoleR","1","The speakers are ridiculous and crackle a TON, off and on, but mostly on. They get progressively worse. If anyone can tell me if there's something I can do to prevent or fix this, it would be appreciated, but I don't think there is. I think it's just a garbage laptop. I've never had so many issues with a laptop, and unfortunately Best Buy has the worst return policy as well. They cut you off at the 14th day instead of the 15th, as if 15th wasn't short enough. This laptop has caused me so much stress and as nice as the employees may be, they insist that even though I tried to return my original laptop on the 15th day, they ""can not"" refund me the money, and can only give me an exchange. This is the only laptop offered by Best Buy that has all the features I wanted, but there are just way too many issues with it. I was so excited, but then I learned the mouse pad doesn't work a lot of the time (I updated all the drivers and still doesn't work), the speakers crackle and even just completely cut out. It gets really hot even with simple internet browsing. It lags and stalls. So apparently I'm going to have to exchange this piece of garbage every 14 days until maybe the employees get sick of seeing my face and decide they can finally give me the refund.... Never shopping at Best Buy or buying Lenovo again.","2","0"
"607","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 12.5"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Iron Gray","Portable laptop, has serious touchpad issues","Kedar","2","I purchased this device because I was looking for something very portable; yet had enough power and speed for multitasking. 

My rating is 2 stars only due to a really annoying issue as mentioned below.

Pros: 
- This laptop is highly portable and lightweight. 
- 8 GB RAM coupled with a Core i5 processor packs enough muscle for multitasking. (PS: I am not a gamer - so if you are looking for performance as related to games, this is not the right review to refer :-))
- The screen size and weight is just right for the laptop mode as well as a tablet mode. Feels great in the tablet mode and the screen is very responsive to touch.

Cons: 
- I have a major issue as of writing this review that whenever I put the laptop to sleep and re-open it, the mouse pointer is nowhere on the screen and the touch pad is completely unresponsive. ONLY a restart solves this issue! I have checked Lenovo support forums where they have instructed to upgrade the drivers etc; but all the mouse drivers are up to date. 
I am not sure what is a permanent solution to this issue. The only option would be to return this if I do not find the right solution.

PS: The laptop upgraded upon initial set up and I diligently followed all instructions for the upgrades, including a touchpad firmware update from Lenovo that was pushed to the device at the time of initial set up!","1","0"

Cons: A bit rough out-of-box experience. W10 Fall Creators Update took LONG time. (I blame MS on this.) Touchpad issue required Lenovo SW update to fix. It says there's still one more touchpad software update to apply but it fails to install. Things work fine now so I'm not going to worry about it. 

8GB/128GB is what I consider sweet spot configuration for ultrabooks. There aren't many offerings like this.

Note this model doesn't come with backlit keyboard unlike other yoga 720 models.

Regarding fan noise, after the sw updates, it doesn't come on all that often for me when I browse using Edge. I was pleasantly surprised because CPU still felt very snappy as if it's running at fast clock speed. When it does come on, it's not bad imo. While I wouldn't use this on bed while my wife is sleeping right next me, its noise is quite tolerable or barely noticeable most times. Latest MS Surface Pro has i5/8GB model without any fan but it's much more costly...","3","1"

Upon initial research I was interested in a Dell Inspiron 15"", HP envy 360 or a HP Pavilion laptop. All of which were a bit high in my price range. A very knowledgeable employee recommended this 2 in 1 laptop after I explained my lifestyle a little bit. 

I was surprised to see how nice a 12.5"" laptop could be considering I transitioned from an 8 year old 15"" laptop. 
The Lenovo 720 is lightweight, compact, and sturdy texture-wise. Thanks to its solid state drive I feel it is very practical and quick for its price. The 7th gen i5 processor is more than sufficient to me considering I am upgrading from an 8 year old laptop. I have a external hard drive so I'm not too concerned with memory on it. 
The keyboard is simplistic and smooth. Easy transition from my old laptop keys to this one and I'm enjoying the process of typing this review on the Lenovo Yoga 720!

Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase!","2","1"

Because it was a floor model I thought maybe some one change settings and caused this condition.
When I received my laptop the cursor was working correctly. A few days later I turned it on and there was no cursor. I couldn't find a solution for the problem so I contacted a Lenovo technician. the technician said the wrong driver was installed on the laptop. eventually the tech uninstalled the mouse and re installed it.
The cursor was working fine. the next day I turned the laptop on and the cursor was gone again. I have since been using the touch screen which can be very annoying at times.
I'm hope hoping this is a software glitch and there will be an update soon to correct it.","7","0"
"611","Lenovo - Yoga 720 2-in-1 12.5"" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Iron Gray","Ungodly loud fan noise all the time","Woody","1","Because BB stores have so much ambient noise you don't hear it in the demo, but this laptop has a terrible fan noise all the time. Not just loud but with an added high pitched whine going too. 

At first I thought it was just my machine, but some research online shows this to be a regular problem with lots of Lenovo yogas (of all models). Being so small it's even more noticeable here though.

And when I say all the time, I mean sitting at the desktop with no applications or background tasks yet the fan still kicks in constantly. So if you are someone with ears then you'll do well to avoid this (and probably the other yoga models too)","35","16"

I was really excited for the 2-in-1 features and the ""four modes"" you can use the computer in. After a few months the switching from tablet to computer mode never went smoothly, and there were a lot of glitches. After owning it for a year it started running extremely slowly and there was about a month's time where it just stopped logging on. After an extremely small fall (about 2.5 ft in a case - which I've never seen fatally damage any of my electronics) the screen cracked and its completely unusable. Disappointing life-span for the cost, I would not spend the money on this again.","1","0"

It's really light and portable and has the windows pen interface to allow her to draw on her PowerPoint slides while teaching. That combined with the touch screen makes it really flexible and usable for her needs. It has a finger print reader that quickly allows one or multiple people to unlock the laptop. The screen resolution and size is perfect and allows viewing without having to wear glasses to see small stuff. As far as speed, it's pretty snappy and we've not seen any sluggishness when loading/using multiple applications and such. Over all a good working laptop.","1","0"

The mouse pad does not work at all and my laptop has had all of the updates that are needed. (NOT AN UPDATE ISSUE) I have had to get the screen replaced multiple times. The computer tends to freeze a lot and also not want to turn on even though it is charged. I was very excited because I bought this computer with my own money and it turned out to be the worst choice in Laptops. I have had the worst experiences and not to mention it gets extremely hot and loud as if your leg feels like it is burning off. So definitely choose a different laptop.","1","0"

It is a great laptop, however the touchpad becomes unresponsive when the laptop recovers from tablet mode or wakes up. I bought two for my daughters and it happened on both.

The fix is easy, but this is an issue that should not have shipped with the laptop. If you go to Lenovo' s website and update all of the drivers and Bios it will fix the problem. This just should not be something that makes it passed qc and out in a finished product. It also took me a while to identify what was causing the fault.","5","0"

The HP Envy X360 is both a solid laptop and a functional tablet. Getting up and running with Cortana was fast and painless. 5 minutes later, I'm browsing the web and watching Netflix on the beautiful 13"" screen - not edge-to-edge, but still stunning visually. The Bang & Olufsen speakers radiate sound and music so loudly it fills the room from such a small, portable device. I'm very impressed.

Battery life is pretty standard for this setup, though I would've liked a 6-cell capacity. Processing speed is fast, with common functions almost instantaneous and most programs with very minimal lag. I like that the keyboard shuts off in tablet mode and remains off even if the computer is slightly ajar to have the screen standing upright. The keyboard keys are very responsive with large visible labeling and spaced out nicely for comfortable typing. Touchscreen is a plus, but in tablet mode, the onscreen keyboard is not a default setting and required some troubleshooting to get it working. Volume and power buttons are a little stiff, but I'm getting used to it.

Overall, this is a sleek, efficient little laptop. The tablet functionality feels more like a gimmick than something that will be used aside from on a plane ride. Other than that, this is an impressive machine for its size. While it won't replace a desktop any time soon, it does make for a very functional portable work and entertainment station.

Full disclosure, I received this product for my honest, unbiased review.","1","0"

As promised, this computer allows one to be more productive, working efficiently with the touch-screen feature (very responsive), and it is also highly personalized to meet one’s specific needs. The keyboard has easy-to-read keys and has a well illuminated backlit feature. It is easy and comfortable to type. The size of the mouse touchpad decent which is smooth and very responsive.
Furthermore, it works smoothly. Windows Hello (face recognition) feature works adequately when the device is put at a certain distance from the face. I am especially fond of Windows Ink as it promotes competence in any project or assignment I work on; I also enjoy drawing. Its performance is great as it works quickly and has sufficient battery life. The speakers have remarkable stereo quality, which I am very excited about.

"623","HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - HP Finish In Dark Ash Silver","Real nice thin laptop! Plusses outweigh minuses.","stuman74","4","Received this a few days ago. As always, takes forever to run though the Windows 10 updates and navigate the HP software popups. But once set up to my customizations, runs real nice and smooth. Very thin and light! Great bright glossy screen. Didn't bog down on any tasks or multiple windows (Office, browser, etc)
.
I like that it has a touch screen and has tablet-like capability, but plan to use as a standard laptop 95% of the time. Still just using a regular old blunt tip stylus, which seems fine, but may get a Bamboo pen as well. Battery seems decent for this form factor.

Main negative is heat. I had some apps running and it warms up a bit more than I'd think it should. Initial 128gb storage also gets eaten up by about 1/2 just with the stock apps and updates. But there is a MicroSD slot if needed for quick expansion.

Overall, for a Windows 10 machine, I like it!

I have owned Lenovos before and they were great"," not a full Windows OS computer. Storage is another issue. It only had 14 gb left when I got it up in running"," the Windows system already takes up 25GB and just with a few windows opened in your browser and it will tell you that you don't have enough memory to keep working. The only thing I have installed was Office and Chrome. Even for less than $160"
"687"," even with the aid of a flash drive helping with the installation. Windows needed space and forced several apps that came with the machine to be uninstalled to free up space. Bottom line 32GB is too low for Win10 and if you download FB and Firefox you are pretty much done with the remainder of the memory. Invest a bit more in a better machine. Too bad for Lenovo to build this useless machine. Very bad impression from a first time Lenovo buyer. No point getting this product at any price.

I can't even change the volume without it freezing sometimes. Also"," the CPU is ALWAYS at 100%. I checked the storage and it's not even half full. I tried deleting temporary files and that did not help either. I wouldn't pay $5 for this laptop if I would have know what it was like. Just splurge a little more if you need a decent laptop.

If you read the description is says Enough high-bandwidth RAM to meet the system requirements and run basic programs"," but not many at once!. My advice if you are looking for a fast laptop go for 8GB RAM; it is $150-$200 more but it is worth specially for those doing many processes at the same time.
3,Lenovo - IdeaPad 11.6 Laptop - Intel Celeron - 2GB Memory - 32GB eMMC Flash Memory - Mineral Gray,Good while it lasted,BGALUM,1,1,The biggest limitation on this system is the fact it is a Windows 10 Device.

This computer runs incredibly slow and I wish I would have spent $150 more and gotten something better since I will have to replace this one since it runs too slow.

I use Microsoft Word and Excel on a daily basis as well as surfing the net. I do not save to much to the HD to begin with so the 32GB of on board storage is ample enough for my needs. In conclusion this Lenovo is a far better choice then the Chrome Book I was going to purchase. Its very convenient and flies through all that I need it to do.

Initially the Inspiron had no issues and by initially I mean the first hour of use. After this initial hour I started noticing slow internet connections and a consistent drop in WIFI signal.

So i contacted Dell support"," and found this Dell to be a worthy replacement.",""," feel and functionality of this laptop. Me and my wife both made the decision to go back to school and where in desperate need for an additional laptop.

After spending 2 hours running through trouble shooting procedures he informed me I would have to send it in to receive a new wireless card!!!! Which blew my mind why would I need a new WIFI card on a $900 laptop i bought 5 hours ago. In stead of shipping it in for repairs and waiting up to 13 days to get it back I decided to take it in and replace it at the best buy with another 7373. I really wanted to love this laptop. But to my disappointment not only did i continue to experience WiFi issues by the mouse pad on my 2nd dell would go in and out even acting on its own at times. So once again I returned this laptop the following day and now I am a happy owner of a Surface laptop which has been operating extremely well over the last 4 days.

Part of the problem is the number of programs that automatically run in the background that drain power even when I'm not on the machine.

So now in spite of that I still decided to purchase this one and right now I would have to give it at this point (45 days in) a B-"," it's fast"," lightweight and seems to be solid (unlike my last one where the plastic components broke off into the fan's housing) I like the touch screen but I hardly ever use it"," however this is where the flaws come in and why at this point I have to give it a B- DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GAMING ONLY PURPOSES because it kills the battery and overheats tremendously matter of fact the battery life sucks period in comparison with my Dell Studio that I gave the triple A+ rating I literally had the same battery for 4 years before it ever gave me the type of battery life that this Dell is giving me brand new straight out of the box is maybe an hour and a half tops"," I also had my Studio Laptop for 5 years before it started getting as hot as this one does"," no errors and everything is hunky-dory"," it's great for browsing the internet and has a very comfortable keyboard and 10 keypad and although it's not a gaming computer the graphics card is pretty good for games like the Sims 3 and 4"
"833"," except I feel slightly misled,guitarpete987,1,5,I have just purchased this computer in the past week. I actually love practically everything about it. It is an exemplary system in virtually every way. It is powerful enough thanks to its excellent latest-generation processor"," it has dedicated graphics which I find goes a LONG way toward making video and photo editing incredibly smooth"," and thus even allows me to run even newer games on medium-high settings. ","",""," DELL YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS I HAVE SEEN YOUR BEST AND THIS ISN'T IT. But for right now it is good I would still recommend it as far as how it's made and comfort but I will say a this a 17 inch laptop doesn't need to be a 2 in 1 if anyone uses it as a 2 in 1 it's only because they don't have a larger monitor to give a presentation on it doesn't even flip that comfortably for me to even consider using it as a 2 in 1 so again it's a good laptop better than the last one I had but not as great a job as I know Dell could do but it is better than some other ones and it gets the job done.

It was taking minutes to open one jpeg image and to open anything else. We went into Best Buy on May 25 hoping they can accept it as a return or exchange it for a different computer that actually works. They said they can only do a factory reset and if it still doesn’t work","I highly recommend this PC to anyone looking to have a good system for video and photo editing with the capability to use it in a desktop fashion or on the go"," the dropbox would not complete its syncing and I just decided to pause syncing. I couldn’t even dare to think about returning as I thought a new computer for which I paid $1200+ cannot be bad and that it will get better. But even after pausing the dropbox syncing"
"839"," Dell wouldn’t really do much more than another factory reset. The hard disk was showing as 100% full and we know from past experiences that this will not get fixed. They can do the factory resets as many times as they want but it won’t get fixed.

It is plenty fast once you have gone through the setup process and allowed sufficient time for all updates to install. Not sure why the one reviewer dogged it so bad. My only complaint is that for a 17.3 inch laptop"," it would expect it to have more ports"," the two non-Type C ports should both be USB 3.1 ports"," instead of one 3.1 and one 2.0.

"840"," 2 TB of storage is a real plus. This is being used as a desktop replacement and the 2-in-1 design allows it to lay flat in a keyboard drawer with a full size keyboard.

I installed a Samsung 512GB M2 NVME card and did a clean install on Windows 10 Professional. Note the unit ships with Windows 10 Home installed. The laptop is shy on ports"," however dell does sell the USB-C Mobile Adapter – DA300 which runs you a extra of about $90 USD. I was surprised that the laptop really does give very decent battery life. The laptop runs very cool with vents on the bottom (Near The Rear) and back (right below the display lid). I purchased a Steklo - X-Stand from Amazon to give it a little more height and ventilation. I would recommend the purchase of a bluetooth mouse to use with the included built-in Bluetooth feature.

38,HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - HP finish in dark ash silver,Does a Great Many Things Well,Hindu,4,5,I've been living with this lappy for about a month now. Pros: brilliant 4k display (to which you can stream HDR video from Netflix or other providers!)...works with my Razer Core gaming dock letting me game almost like a desktop when connected to the Core on my desk...solid keyboard with good feel and travel on the keys...large touchpad with good feel and control...good sound level (with tricks...see below) although like almost every lappy without a subwoofer it's a bit base deficient. Cons...often runs a bit warm on your lap streaming 4k HDR vid (a lapboard of some type eliminates this and helps the sound)...no HDMI port for monitor output (requires a usb-c to hdmi dongle if you need this)...a bit klunky @ 2.8 lbs in tablet mode. Exploits: YEAH it works with the Razer Core out of the box allowing me to drive a GTX 1080 external video card and 4k HDR external display. No add'l drivers for the Core are required but you will have to load the NVIDIA drivers for whatever video card you have in the Core before it will work as designed...not a hard process. ANY OF THIS 4K HDR STUFF REQUIRES THAT WINDOWS 10 BE (free through Windows Update) UPGRADED TO VERSION 1709xx or better. To do full 4k HDR on the external display you will need to shift to 10 bit color (YCbCr422 color format & 10bpc color depth in Nvidia Control Panel) and of course your external display must be at least capable of YCbCr422/10bpc. If all this is met 4k UHD HDR gaming is possible! On the INTERNAL DISPLAY forget anything but light gaming...to be expected on a 2.8 lb laptop. BUT 4k UHD HDR video streaming to the internal display possible IF you completely remove the HP provided driver (do this from APPS page of settings and restart otherwise the Intel driver refuses to install) for the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics card and then install the latest graphics driver for the UHD 620 from the intel website (23 series or better) and PRESTO you will see the 4K UHD and HDR tags appear (assuming you have upgraded your Netflix acct. to subscribe to this and don't forget to change the settings to allow high data usage/high quality vid...FIGURE ON 5-7 GB/HR DATA USAGE FOR THIS!!) on your Netflix faves like Stanger Things","All this for under $1000 makes it quite a bargain.

"877"," I can tell you that the sound with my AKG earbuds plugged in is excellent! Ok...last one. I purchased a generic usb-c dongle to provide an extra usb-a 3.0 port/hdmi out/additional usb-c port. This machine ONLY has 2 usb-c's (one of which will be your power connector when plugged in) one usb-a 3.0 port and micro SD card slot. That's it! You might not need more but I do. Hope this helps someone. A lot of the above is advanced work but it CAN be done if you want. It took me about a week to get it all up and operating. BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A FANTASTIC LITTLE LAPTOP which will do so much more than you think if you want to put a little work into it. Otherwise just open the box and use it...with the sound exploit...and the 4k display and the Coffee Lake (8th gen) processor it will leave you impressed!!
2,HP - Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - HP finish in dark ash silver,Took a chance"," worth it.,Codai,0,5,I recently bought this laptop because I was heading to graduate school. I was hung up on all the different 2-in-1 laptops that had there own ups and downs. One thing that people brought up was the temperature. When I first got the laptop and had to update things"," it did run pretty warm. But a lot of people solved this problem by updating all the system BIOS and required HP updates. After all the updates"," it will conduct heat more as compared to plastic or other larger computers where the CPU or battery are located farther from where you usually touch the computer. Just to make sure"," I installed a CPU temp monitoring program which allows me to see the temperature of the computer. When the laptop feels hot I check the temp of the CPU and find it around 54-56~ F when using it for a while"," Marco Polo etc. Then make sure the windows settings for HDR are turned on in the Display Settings page...one at the top for Stream HDR Video and one at the bottom...UNCHECK the box for Don't Stream HDR Video on Battery. Choose your show...watch screen brightness jump to full if you're on AC power...on battery you have to do it manually...and sit back and watch the beautiful video stream! Ok...full disclosure: Intel says this is NOT full HDR video but EDR (Extended Dynamic Range) since the integrated display is only an 8-bit panel...but I gotta tell you it's GOOD! I can hardly distinguish it from the real thing on my fully 10 bit capable eternal monitor. NOTHING I have recommended or described here should affect your warranty status...it's all software driven except the acquisition of the Core and whatever video card you put in it...IF YOU WANT HDR ON YOUR EXTERNAL MONITOR IT'S GOTTA BE A 10xx SERIES CARD WITH AT LEAST 3GB OF RAM!! Next one: the sound. Go into an app called Bang & Olufsen Control (already installed by HP) click the OUTPUT tab and shift it to the mode of your choice (movie/music/voice) and turn all the sliders up full. Volume will increase DRMATTICALLY! It will be skewed to the high end of the spectrum but there will actually be some bass audible now. Adjust sliders to taste. If the sound level drops...which mine does occasionally after a system restart just go to the GENERAL tab and click DEFAULT SETTINGS. Then repeat the above OUTPUT setting procedure and the (otherwise deficient)volume returns! And if none of this does it for you"," the laptop has been running much more cooler. Because the laptop itself has a metal body"
"878"," in all honesty"," you need to really be leaning in and listening to the computer to hear it. Also"," unless you use computers is super quite spaces"," responsive"," beautiful to look at and use. The pen included works really well and feels nice"," which is normal beyond belief for laptops these days. A lot of people also mention a whining/Whirring noise when the keyboard light it lit up"," the sound will ultimately be drowned out by background noise or study music. It has been fast"
"879"," it fits nice and snug. The only other down side I did find was that one of the laptop hinges are a little miss aligned compared to the other side. I was worried at first"," but it isn't as miss aligned as what other people may have. The hinge does not creek"," squeak"," but I also have it covered under warranty just in case. Because it barely effects my usage of the laptop and does't seem to affect the screen"," in my situation"," not sure for people who may have larger hands or wide grips. The laptop sleeve it comes with is also great for transporting the laptop"," or come close to scratching the surrounding body of the computer.

"883"," the 3 key had an issue of being very mushy and occasionally not registering that I had pressed it; however"," something may have just been stuck under the key because it now feels and works properly after a week of use. My main concern with this second unit is that the hinges seem to be a bit uneven. They are flared out a bit and are not flush with the body at all. At first I thought they were designed to be flared out"," but upon closer inspection the amount of unevenness in the hinges is not consistent between the two. I took it back into Best Buy and they said that's how the hinges are supposed to look"," this thing will light your lap on fire. I get that there is a beefy processor inside such a tiny form factor"," but I swear I could fry an egg on the underside of this thing even after doing something as simple as writing in onenote. ","Now onto my complaints. The first device I purchased had an N key that did not press down at all. It would not register that I pressed the key at all. I exchanged that one for a second model. On the second unit"," but I am a bit hesitant still. Especially after looking at other photos online. Lastly"
"884"," the specs of the product and the feel of it seem to be well worth the cost of admission. Certain things like the hinges and the fact that I feel like my legs might light on fire have me a bit concerned about the longevity of a laptop like this"," but that's why you pay for geeksquad right?

I can connect my usb 3 sd card reader to the usb a port and my external ssd to one of the thunderbolt ports. That still leaves a port open to either charge or connect something else. The ac adapter is small and uses usb c so you have two ports you can connect to for charging. You can also use a usb c or thunderbolt dock depending on the bandwidth you need. My only issue is this seems to get hot under load and from some reviews the cooling isnt as good in this laptop as some others with the same chipset and quad core i7 processor.

I found the 1-mm protrusion of the u-SD is hardly noticeable. This small protrusion is needed to allow easy extraction of the SD card: by pushing the SD card until it bottoms out and let go quickly so that it will pop out ~5mm to be pulled out easily.

AMD's set up i think can be arguably compared to Nvidias GTX 1050TI which is a very good entry level card. With the ability to switch to vega 8 for power concerns this laptop will be able to adapt based on its environment. ","Overall"," for a good price"
"988","","","","","","Out of the box this is a very nice and simplistic looking laptop. Its not over the top in the way of design and offers a key layout which should suit just about most gamers out there. The WASD layout is very nice and visible and the key back lighting is done nice. One drawback is that i wish the keyboard had more color options or even the ability to dim the lights. They are either on or off. The laptop offers an IPS display which im not too fond of as they usually are not that bright or vibrant. However the screen display was very bright with vibrant colors which was a breath of fresh air. With the IPS display don't expect to game or stream in 4k either. The speakers put out decent sound but this shouldn't be an issue as most gaming is done with headphones on anyways. I got about 3 hours of battery life before needing a charge on medium settings. There is also no CD drive so keep that in mind when purchasing. This is not a big issue for me as i do alot of gaming on Steam anyways.",""
"989"," it looked as if they pull from the same junction which seems kinda of like a waste and may be why it heated up rather quickly. Either way about 3 hours in to my game my temperature seemed to stabilize and i saw no issues from this in the form of frame rate drop or lag. Im used to gaming with Nvidia set up and don't have too much experience with just how well AMD's radeon can perform so i put it to the test while playing Fortnite. While playing and maxing out all my settings in game i got a very good and smooth 80 frames. I was really impressed and even how to double check to make sure i wasn't reading that wrong. It just seemed almost unrealistic for a laptop to run that smooth and during some of my high action fighting there was never once any drop outs or lag issues. In the past when i run my settings on max load they usually give me a disadvantage as there tends to be hiccups in the display and i usually end up dead before i get a chance to line up my target. This was not an issue here at all. While playing Call of Duty"," action sequences were smooth and color display was vibrant throughout the whole game with no visible streaking. Having a built in web cam with mic also was a nice feature to have for some live streaming. Although i never really utilized the cam during gaming i had no issues setting it up and using it to chat with some friends. Display was smooth and streaming was very fluid with no blurs or lag.","","","","I don't want to drag this on with the specifics as all the specs can be found here on Best Buy. What i want to do is really focus on what this laptop was meant to do which is gaming and how well it can handle it in to the longer hours. One of the biggest issues i have noticed with some of the lower end laptops in my past is issues with heat distribution during the longer hours of gaming. This laptop does pretty well into the longer hours while playing some of the older games like civilization on the higher settings. I didn't really feel it start to heat up till about the third hour. However while playing Call of Duty i started to really notice the heat temperature rise well in to the end of the first hour. Granted my settings were maxed out but the heat never got to the point where i felt i could not lay it on my lap. Taking apart the laptop was easier than i thought it would be and once apart i noticed the fan layout. I noticed they put the fans side by side instead of separating them on opposite ends for better heat distribution. Now i didn't want to mess the laptop up taking apart the heat channels to see if they ran to their own separate fan but by the looks of it",""

Heat dissipation is not the best but its not horrible either and does not seem to effect game play. The only thing that kinda of worries me a bit is the fact that i have only put a week of testing in to this. In the past i have seen and heard mix reviews of Acers line up for gaming laptops and while this is the first one i have owned i would keep in mind that there have been issues with screen displays going out. Now while i wanted to throw that out there for you i want you to also know that i have at this time yet to run in to any issues. Everything has been flawless and quite impressive that i am in almost disbelief that this laptop runs this good. I just hope that this can stand the test of time but if that is a concern of yours as it is mine my suggestion would be get this laptop as it is a good gaming laptop just make sure to get a warranty and you should be good to go.

"1001"," as expected from most laptops"," is nothing to get excited about -it is decent and loud"," but with no bass at all. It does feature Dolby Audio so using headphones is basically a must.

I’ve mostly nitpicked in this review"," it’s difficult to figure out what exact type and model you’re getting."
"1125"," it means it can do more without bogging down your system. It has 8GB of RAM which should allow you to run several softwares at once. However"," when it comes to gaming"," more is usually better. 8GB is enough for most games today. Going forward"," a 256GB SSD is installed using a M.2 interface. Dell’s support documentation list procedures for both M.2 and SATA drives but confusingly labels the 2.5” drive as hard drive and the M.2 as “Solid State Drive.” (Note: SSD can come in either 2.5” drive form factor using SATA interface or M.2 form factor.)","","The model being reviewed here is a G7 Series 15 7588. It features an Intel Core i7 8750H processor that has 6 cores capable of 12 threads of execution. In layman terms"," that may change. The 8GB of RAM is rated at DDR4 2666 or PC4 21300 and is preinstalled in 2x4GB. Upgrading the memory will mean purchasing a new set (in a pair) rather than a single. For storage"
"1126","","","","","","The laptop features a 15.6 inch display with a 1920x1080 resolution on a IPS panel. That display is powered by both Intel’s integrated graphics and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 “Max-Q” GPU. There is a dedicated 6GB of video memory which will allow the GPU to perform better without relying on system memory and its limited bandwidth. The performance review of the 1060 GPU will come shortly.",""
"1127"," it is powered by RealTek and has stereo speakers on the front side of the laptop. However"," the laptop design itself is angled so the speakers are aimed downwards. Unfortunately"," the speakers aren’t all that good and doesn’t have good range on them. They’re more on the high side and the bass/lows are very lacking. (Tested using a few Beatles songs and Luv(sic) Part 2 by Nujabes) The only way to potentially get a better audio experience will be to use your own headphones","","","On the audio side"," either through Bluetooth or the 3.5mm headphone jack."

The Gigabit Ethernet port worked as expected and I was able to transfer about 36GB of data from my desktop over to the laptop.

This computer probably costs less than your smartphone and/or tablet"," your sneakers might even cost a bit more - which means there are tradeoffs to make and trying to compare this computer to something that costs $200 more would be a mistake. For one"," it is not the fastest of processors","That concludes my review. Overall"," in fact"
"1379"," and it only has a 32GB hard drive (it's really MMC). Yes"," it is also made of plastic"," it has no fancy OLED"," and the screen does have an ugly bezel around it. ...so"," we could probably assume that you are not buying this computer to play the latest games or to show off at the local coffee shop. So why buy this computer? Perhaps you're the type of person that only browses the web and checks email"," it only has 4GB of RAM (which is 2GB more than most other systems around the same cost)"," it's not even a 1080p screen resolution (just 1366x768)"
"1380"," maybe you're buying for a senior citizen or a child in your family who's just getting started with computers"," perhaps you just want a computer to tinker with and install a Linux distro"," you just need something to keep connected to a 3D printer or a security camera"," I just needed something to run specific software a few times a month that could connect to an HDMI source"," was portable"," or maybe you just want to play some basic games from the Windows App Store and watch YouTube videos"," or maybe you travel and need something to view pictures or other documents on the go and don't feel like carrying your more powerful heavy laptop or risk the loss of your super expensive flagship laptop/tablet. In my case"

"1382"," I am happy with how the computer runs"," in fact"," I was expecting something much slower and like the netbooks from a few years ago. This computer is a bit strange compared to other similar choices since it has an AMD A6 instead of an Intel Celeron (do not compare to an i3 - that's just a different category) and 4GB of RAM. The AMD processor clocks higher than the Intel"," the AMD processor needs about 50% more memory than the Intel counterpart. The AMD does include entry level Radeon R4 graphics"," which is another plus over intel. Since the computer only has 32GB for storage","So far"," perhaps helping the system perform a bit better. The 4GB of RAM might sound better than the competing units that only have 2GB or RAM; however"
"1383"," installing Office 2016"," and the software I needed"," I'm only left with 4.12GB; but"," there's battery life - if you need the battery life over performance"," go with the Inspiron 11 that has the Celeron CPU. Battery life on this machine is about as bad as it was with the netbooks of the past"," after uninstalling 2 pieces of McAfee software (get rid of it and just use Windows defender)"," that's not a problem since I stuck a 256GB Micro SD into it and have everything I need on there. Finally"
"1384"," you may be able to squeeze 9 hours or so out of the system; where most higher-end computers today may get about 12 hours or more.

",""," perhaps about 4-5 hours with the screen at half brightness and trying to get work done at the same time; which is bad considering my normal laptop gets about 9 hours doing the same thing. If you really dim it and aren't listening to audio or watching videos"," get the Intel Celeron model. In using the word performance I don't mean going from a scooter to a crotch rocket; but"
"1385"," it won't take 6 hours to install the updates"," it's just because I hate sitting and waiting and even went on a long hike with the dogs while the computer updated. Once those updates are 100% completed"," the computer should boot-up in a matter of seconds"," Excel"," and OneNote boot-up in about 6-8 seconds. The one bug I've encountered is when going into Settings - sometimes the app just stalls and doesn't fully open","In some reviews people are complaining that the computer is slow right out of the box - that's because computers with these specs can't multitask so well and when you first open there's likely tons of updates to install from Microsoft and Dell. It's also probably trying to synch your OneDrive or Dropbox if you set those up when prompted (I would ignore the OneDrive/Dropbox prompts until the other updates are done and you format a micro-SD card).

Going from laptop to tablet mode is a breeze and the keyboard is automatically deactivated so that no key presses intervenes while using it in tablet mode. This is another area that was my favorite. Using the included Active Pen to draw and write with Windows Ink was so easy and fun. It also can tell if your palm is resting on the screen as to not pick it up.

The first day I just set it up and went to work. The second day (today) I started the laptop and clicked on the web browser to log in to my email (imagine just 2 minutes of working) that all of a sudden the laptop stopped working and desktop changed to gray and then got darker and darker and then off. But the computer was still on and was getting warmer and warmer. I immediately put it in its box and took it back to best buy. It took me 15 min to get to the costumer service representative. When we opend the box the laptop was melting!! SUPER HOT!! Still on but desktop was off. They accepted the return and I decided to get a similar one as the representative told me he hadn't seen such a problem before and kinda reassured me. I got the new one and came back home. I started working with it while it was getting charged for the first time. Imagine what: AGAIN SO SO SO HOT!!! It was not possible to put the laptop on my laps and work for even 10 min. I gave up and turned it off and put it aside. Then it got gradually cooler but still warm. I tried once more and connected the charger but again got hot.","","","","","All that said I give this laptop an overall average rating. If it were a sub $1k laptop",""

The laptop operates as quick and smooth as any windows machine I have had an opportunity to use. There is a backlit keyboard and a 13.9 inch touch screen. Even though the screen on this version is HD instead of quad HD the quality is very good with sharp text and great color reproduction.

This laptop played most of my games on steam at max settings without a problem. The best thing about this laptop is how easy upgrading is. All upgradable components are easily accessible and you can even add a 2nd hard drive for additional storage. Even though this was made for gaming"," it handles everyday tasks extremely well due to the i7 processor. Perfect balance of performance. The blue lit keyboard is a plus as well as the feel of the keyboard. There are only two downsides"," one being the screen. It is anti glare and doesn't get to bright. It is easy to see from any angles so while I prefer bright screens some will prefer anti glare over brightness. The other thing I wish was better was the size of the power brick. It is huge so picking a good laptop bag is important. It wasn't an issue for me since I use a backpack but still adds bulk.

"1727"," lite"," and thin,Darren,0,5,Purchased because it was an 8th generation CPU with 16 gb of memory. I wanted the 1080p screen but ended up in the 4k screen. Honestly a 4k screen in the 13 inch format is a waste. You lose battery running the screen and you have to scale it up 200% which makes it a 1080p screen in order to read the text. I am not sure you would notice a difference with a movie. The laptop feels fairly durable but I intend to treat it like $1500 investment and not physically abuse it.

It got so hot that you could barely touch it or put it on your lap. I guess the issue here is that HP decided to put the heating vents on the bottom of the laptop and not on the sides.

This definitely allowed me to do that. I am used to a 15” laptop but with the 4K screen the viewing is even better than my large computer. I have no issue with heat or fan noise mentioned by others. I am a techy gadget girl and have owned a ton of laptops. This one beats them all by a mile! I can’t recommend it enough.

However"," i hate how the manufactur fails the monitor. It looks bend (monitor) and the right side hinge doesnt give any space between the monitor and the keyboard resulting small friction that i had to cover up using my watch screen protector. I hate how my very brand new laptop now have a small scratch on the upper right hinge because of the friction. I already put in a screen protector and a webcam cover and i dont want to exchange it because i will lose the screen protector and webcam cover. Hate it that this happens.

Needless to say"," with 512G storage. There was some special sale pricing going on that week so I only paid around $100 more vs the Lenovo. I have been very happy with it so far. Very fast on startup because it is solid state. Very lightweight which is a feature I need for traveling vs my old Dell laptopwhich is quite heavy(almost 7 years old). The ability to fold it into a tablet is handy for games or movies but so far I’ve used it most of the time with the keyboard. The touch screen is very nice to have and the track pad has new gestures that I’m learning and have found useful. Overall"," aesthetically and functionally. It is blazingly fast"

It is very pretty-- mainly my reason I went for this one. One of the first 8th gen to come out too. Stylus is great-- I don't have much use for it but it is good to have it. The hinge of the laptop though is a little too loose-- the screen angle moves out of position easily when you lift the pc. The clickpad is a little wonky. I'm trying to understand why the right click is not as responsive or the two finger gesture to scroll up is not doing it right. I just use a mouse anyway or I use the touchscreen more on this one. Right ctrl button is confusing to use with the left arrow. Other than that"," but its only been TWO weeks. I haven't even downloaded anything on to it yet! It makes it impossible to do anything when the pointer/touchpad/cursor freeze up every few minutes. Of course I am one day past the return dates so I basically just wasted $1600. I wish this didn't happen"," already having some of the issues that I experienced with the previous one. This is a great computer when it works.

Bought my son one for college and less then a year started having charging issues. Sent it to be fix under warranty and ended up having to be replaced with a different computer after they shattered the screen. Less than a year after that the so called refurbished computer had the same issue as the first. Apparently Dell has a connection on the motherboard which checks if the charger is a Dell Charger so that only dell chargers can be used. That piece has failed both times. Now my daughter is having the same issue on her laptop. It is still under warranty and is there supposedly getting repaired. A one time issue i can expect but 3 times. Dell has an issue that they need to address. Until then...don't buy this computer.

I was really displeased with the speakers. They aren't good sound quality and they are on the bottom of the laptop so they are hard to hear if it is sitting on your lap. The battery life was by far the worst part. It would last like 5 hours at the absolute most. I would say for an average person who wants a little laptop and won't use it constantly this is fine. If you are anyone else","About once or twice while using the PC the browser stalls and informs me that it is trying to recover the website that I am currently veiwing.

It has many features that make it an ideal piece of equipment for a college student"," convenience"," functionality","I would recommend it to a friend"," including its superior mobility"
"1791"," which many laptops and tablets cannot do. Although its price tag is not ideal for a student"," its ability to function as an “all-in-one” machine bolsters it above and beyond similar products within the same price range. ","","",""," and its vast accessory collection. The Surface can replace most items inside of my backpack",""
"1792"," its ability to detach from its keyboard and operate as a standalone tablet is a key feature. This allows the user to enter “tablet mode” and utilize specific functions that can benefit a student. For those who opt to buy eBooks"," rather than carry several textbooks from class-to-class"," tablet mode is very helpful. Tablet mode allows you to separate the magnetically-attached keyboard and hold the Surface"," an Apple iPad"," or even an actual book. This is especially helpful for long study sessions where I’d like to lay back on the couch"," When it comes to the Surface’s mobility and convenience"," just as you would an Amazon Kindle"
"1793"," so I don’t have to purchase an aftermarket item to accomplish this feat. The convenience factor that the Surface introduces to the laptop and tablet market is truly remarkable.","","","",""," rather than have the inconvenience of keeping a laptop in my lap. The Surface also has a built-in kickstand to hold itself up",""
"1794"," its functionality is another strong feature. The Surface matches the processing power of competitors’ laptops and it does this within the confines of a tablet. It runs Microsoft Windows 10 and a plethora of other applications"," which can assist college students in various ways. For example"," the Microsoft Store offers free applications that include daily planners/calendars"," .PDF conversion software"," and countless other applications that students will find useful. It also comes with one USB port"," Along with the Surface’s mobility and convenience"," calculators"
"1795"," Amazon Kindle to name a couple) do not offer. This allows for quick and easy data transfers from the tablet to other computers. Its ability to perform multiple tasks at once"," both on-screen and off"," allows the Surface to lead the way for other multi-function machines of its caliber.","",""," which most major competitors (Apple iPad",""
"1796"," it also has unique accessories that can boost its appeal to college students. When utilized with other applications"," these accessories allow the tablet to become more versatile. For example"," if you were to purchase a Surface stylus"," notebooks"," and paper. The Surface screen calculates the pressure of your writing and will make strokes according to the pressure being applied. This eliminates the need for pens"," To assist with the Surface’s functionality"," the Microsoft store offers applications that allow you to use the tablet screen as a “paper” to take notes on. This can eliminate costs for buying binders"
"1797"," markers and even highlighters from a student’s budget! While accessories will add more to the Surface’s overall price tag"," they also eliminate the need for other school-related purchases and condense the contents needed for day-to-day school work. ","","",""," pencils",""
"1798"," but these are not necessarily a “need” for a student. It is nice that the keyboard can detach from the tablet"," but this provides little more than comfort. Its USB port is very handy"," but a student can bypass the need for one by utilizing e-mail"," I believe that the Surface allows for the biggest bang for a student’s buck.",""," The red-flag that may send a college student looking for another option is the Surface’s price. There is a large selection of laptops and tablets on the market that are much easier on the pockets. Many of these options will perform the needed tasks and functions that a student is searching for. There are many convenient benefits that the Surface offers"," or a third-party cloud share. Although a student could meet their needs with a cheaper machine"
"1799"," mobility"," functionality"," and accessory selection is matched by none. The money and time that it will save you alone is worth the purchase. ","",""," The Surface is a fantastic piece of machinery that any college student could pick up and benefit from immediately. The Surface’s convenience",""
"1800"," in terms of its usefulness to today’s college student. I would strongly recommend this product for any one looking for either a laptop or a tablet.

At the same time"," This product has a five-star rating from me"," or MacBook after the display on my 2011 MacBook Air began to fizzle out. Apple's latest offerings really frustrated me due to the fact that they refuse to adopt touchscreen technology in their Macs (resorting only to a wishy-washy"
"1801"," I took a deep breath and made the jump.","","","",""," the Surface Pro 4 was full of bugs and the battery life from what I had heard was pretty awful. I would have loved to have picked the iPad Pro for its size and battery life but there are too many programs I need to be able to use on a regular basis that cannot be replicated by the iPad Pro. So when the Surface Pro 2017 came out",""
"1802"," phone calls and FaceTime calls from your MacBook. I should mention that Microsoft is currently working on more or less solutions to these issues"," but they're all awkward because Apple purposely rigs their phones for competitive advantages when used with Macs"," and because of MSFT's general incompetency they aren't meeting their planned deadlines for releasing such features as of yet. I also miss the fact that some things I've gotten used to having"," where my photo edits synced seamlessly and nondestructively from my phone to my MacBook"," is now clunkily replicated on the Windows version","The biggest thing I've missed about coming back from a Mac is the ease of Continuity between apps. There's none of the pick-up-where-you-left-offness that you might have gotten from your iPhone and MacBook. The other thing I miss is the ability to answer iMessages"," such as iCloud Photo Library"
"1803"," and you also have to manually re upload photos you've edited back into iCloud.","","","",""," where the changes ARE destructive and require that you constantly make new copies of the photos you choose to edit",""
"1804"," and on top of that I do notice that for all the progress it's made since I left"," Windows 10 is still somewhat buggier than MacOS"," or at least gives the perception of being buggier. But the things I LOVE about the Surface are HUGE. I LOVE that the screen is worlds better than my MacBook Air in a machine that costs about the same price. I LOVE that I have all the power of a complete desktop OS in a tablet form factor with a real keyboard that feels good to type on"," for all my academic work"," and that the applications I use are not gimped the way a tablet's apps are. I LOVE the fact that the creative applications I DO use on a regular basis","So those are the things that I've missed since switching"," unlike the iPad Pro"
"1805"," are worlds better than the alternatives on iPad excepting the new Affinity Photo"," and that those same apps are also better than what is on Mac because of the touchscreen that has made my workflow much faster"," more intuitive"," I LOVE that all of these things came in a package that supplants the functionality that otherwise would have required a separate MacBook Pro and iPad Pro purchase for me"," which saves me hundreds of dollars and gives me tons of portable versatility that I would never have experienced otherwise. Yes"," like Adobe's Creative Cloud"," and much easier to implement. Once you have edited your photos using the Surface Pen it's really hard to go back to using a mouse. And the last thing is"
"1806"," and I think for those of you who are even less invested in Apple's paid subscription services than I am will find that it's an easier decision now than ever before.

In the end"," I had the opportunity to try both"," it's been a tough jump to go back to Windows after 7 years of living all Apple. But it's a jump that I'm so happy to have made"," Word.

"1808"," the industrial angles look sleek"," and the screen is fantastic. The [rather expensive] catch is that to make the Surface Pro be all Microsoft envisions"," you have to dump an extra $99 minimum to add the Pen"," which"," is not an insignificant investment.","The build is superb"," and then another $150 to get the keyboard"
"1809"," the i5 with higher memory capacity rather than the i7 because I wanted the fanless (i.e. quieter) version"," and I'm not disappointed. ","","","","I opted for the middle of the pack",""
"1810"," although significant"," still fall far short of an actual desktop OS. Furthermore"," even though it's not a knock against the actual iPad"," but even though I wouldn't say I have particularly gargantuan hands"," I found myself making way too many typos and looking down to physically locate keys. ","The main negative with the iPad Pro from a work/productivity standpoint was the new changes with iOS 11"," the official Apple smart keyboard was dismal to type on.

"1811"," sold separately"," types much better and the keys feel more akin to a regular desktop keyboard. The tradeoff is that the Microsoft keyboard flexes more than the Apple.","","","","The Microsoft keyboard",""
"1812"," and being able to hotkey my most used functions to the onboard eraser button makes my workflow more efficient.","","","","","The Surface pen works great",""
"1813"," then I'd say skip the Surface Pro and just get an actual laptop"," as there are tradeoffs as mentioned above.

1,Microsoft - Surface Pro – 12.3” Touch-Screen – Intel Core i5 – 8GB Memory – 256GB Solid State Drive (Latest Model) - Silver,It's great but...,AECarlson,0,5,I finally upgraded from Android tablets to a Surface Pro. I've purchased 3 Android tablets in the past 4 years","If you don't particularly need a pen functionality"," then take a good look at the Surface Pro. Most"
"1814"," and I've not really been entirely satisfied with them. Not enough storage space"," and adding a SD card is worthless"," since you can't edit files on it. They are good for games and streaming"," and the Droid tablets loaded them painfully slow. The Surface tablet loads large images as fast as my desktop PC. I can also install the same software on the surface"," it's nearly as powerful as my desktop machine. I got the keyboard/cover for it and it is way cooler than I had thought it would be. That magnetic attachment system really works great"," the latest being a Galaxy Tab"," but I want to do more serious stuff. My main purpose for a tablet is to handle a large collection of photographs. I like to show some of my pictures to guests and be able to edit them as well. My images are on a server in my home"
"1815"," but it has not arrived yet. The face recognition feature works like a charm"," as long as I have my glasses on"," and the tablet logs me in in a instant. I've had a couple of small issues with the Surface though. The WiFi adapter crashed a couple of times. The Wizard that runs when this happens says there is a problem with the adapter"," but it don't work. I found that turning Bluetooth off and back on again restores the connection. Selecting text without a mouse is much harder on the Surface compared to my Droid tablets. My only other nags are the typical Windows 10 things"," like changing my default programs to Microsoft's apps. This is my fourth Windows 10 computer and they all do these annoying little things. I've got a list of things that bother me about Win 10"," as does the magnetic power connection. I ordered the Surface pen as well"," but it don't tell you what the problem is and it can't fix it. A reboot fixes the issue. It supposedly has the most recent driver already. Hope they come up with a better one in the future. Another problem is my Bluetooth mouse fails to reconnect when the Surface wakes up from sleep. The computer thinks the mouse is connected"
"1816"," I still like it better than previous versions. I'm thrilled with my new Surface Pro"," Android tablets are toys compared to this thing.
3,Microsoft - Surface Pro – 12.3” Touch-Screen – Intel Core i5 – 8GB Memory – 256GB Solid State Drive (Latest Model) - Silver,Great device"," but be aware of one thing...,downeaster59,0,5,A few days ago"," 8gb"," 256gb) after looking at a number of similar devices.

"1817"," its fanless design"," and the positive reviews I have seen on it. ","","",""," relatively light weight",""
"1818"," the SP lives up to the hype. The display is excellent. Its overall performance is quite good. Startup and shutdown times are reasonably quick. The SP handles most apps/programs that I have thrown at it without missing a beat. The speakers have good volume"," and aren't bad at all compared to similar devices. The SP is somewhat sparse on ports"," but I don't need many"," the device never gets very warm. ","","For the most part"," so that's no issue. Construction seems to be high-quality and solid. Despite having a true i5 and no fan"
"1819"," depending on how you will use the SP. ","","","","","Its cable/charging cord is a little short. You need to buy the Type Cover to get the most out of this device. The pen is optional",""
"1820"," you'll see that the SP comes with a Samsung SSD that seems to have excellent performance. My SP"," however"," came with a Toshiba SSD (that never seems to be on the reviewer's devices) which offers more modest performance numbers. Granted that Microsoft never promises that ALL its SPs have the Samsung SSD. But to put those out there for reviewers creates a false impression"," as far as that goes. ","","Here's the one thing to be aware of: don't trust the reviews too much. On the reviews"," at the very least. Buyer beware"
"1821"," I have not seen some of the problems that some users have had with their SPs - such as light bleed. ","","","","","On the other hand",""
"1822"," I am quite pleased with the SP. I am less than pleased with Microsoft's marketing tactics that involve reviewers. Having components from various sources in a device may be common practice"," but it does not inspire much confidence in the manufacturer. The only exception would be if it was shown that the Toshiba drives performed in real world usage just as well as the Samsungs. We shall see. ","","","","Overall",""
"1823"," even with this caveat"," I can recommend the SP.
1,Microsoft - Surface Pro – 12.3” Touch-Screen – Intel Core i5 – 8GB Memory – 256GB Solid State Drive (Latest Model) - Silver,Experience softens the price,pinballtec,0,5,I researched this to no end. The bulk of reviews kept comparing other models to the Surface line"," and currently it appears as though the Surface is the pinnacle of the 2 in 1. I was tossed because I knew I wanted certain features"," so that left out Chromebooks. I chose the i5 variation because all i7 models (not just Surface"," but most laptops / tablets / etc) reviewed shared heat concerns and fan noise. For that price point and what I planned to do","Still"," notably the pen / Windows Ink capability. I wanted the functionality of a desktop"
"1824"," what I've known to be true in computer set up since the 80's was turned on it's side. It offered a humanistic approach"," speaking naturally and asking questions. It's kind of surreal. Once you get past all that"," it's more of typical Windows 10 machine"," which is a shame. I did purchase those items"," and they connect to the tablet physically w/ magnets and integrate to the tablet functionality with ease. The charger"," I wasn't going to require that kind of power. My desktop is an i7 and I don't think I've pushed that to it's limits ever. From the moment you turn it on"," and to that it works with great effect. The keyboard and pen do NOT come with this"
"1825"," also connects magnetically. There is a camera on the front and back"," and if enabled"," it can use the camera to log you in as security measure. The adjustment stand on the back is solid and adjust to any angle. The unit itself overall feels well constructed. I've seen other reviews concerning light bleed with the screen"," it doesn't lend itself to immediate portability like an iPad does. It's heavy"," much heavier than an iPad. It's a trade off for tech at this time"," which is included"," but I didn't or don't see that. The unit is completely silent. Even though this has table like functionality"
"1826"," the minor issues I've had relate more to the Windows experience and not with the functionality or design of the Surface.

The Intel HD Graphics 620 is capable to drive an external monitor with 4K at 60 Hz and many games by standard. i5 7300U has better base frequency (2.5 GHz) when comparing it with i7 7660U in i7 edition; so the basic tasks will be comparable. I am not a big fan of a lot of storage on the tab like device. I think 256 GB is more than enough for most of the daily needs. For extra space"," an external SSD would be the most affordable and practical solution.","","",""," and I prefer the functionality over the need to carry it around for long periods of time like a tablet. So far",""
"1827"," 10 tabs on Edge"," Outlook running with the work and personal account"," 2-3 Microsoft Word"," Skype for Business etc. are kept open concurrently.

"1828"," i7 7660U with 8 GB RAM has no advantage over the i5 version with 8 GB RAM except the higher graphics (Intel Iris Plus 640) and higher turbo frequency i7 7660U has (4 GHz vs 3.5 GHz). The shortage of RAM will haunt us here in this model as well.","","","","","In my humble opinion",""

The bevels are perfectly radiused"," the thickness of the entire tablet is not too big and not too small"," and the weight is not as bad as you would think. The kickstand is one of the best features! I was amazed at how much I used to prop up my iPad or use the case as a stand. The hardware inside (i5"," and 256gb HD) is perfect. The fanless design keeps the heat disapated across the entire back of the tablet instead of one location. It is very easy to adjust the power setting to extend the battery life or utilize the processor. Windows 10 is fantastic on this device.

I LOVE the surface book but am now returning my second as the quality control on this unit is awful or I just have terrible luck. It is light"," It has good speed for basic computing"," the speakers sound good. But the touch screen has failed on two units in a row. I follow all windows instructions and guess what. The first screen was getting phantom strikes every 1-3 seconds making the pc impossible to use without turning off the touch screen. The second worked for two days and now the entire right side of the screen does not recognize it is being touched. Love the design but for 1200-1300 I expect a product that has been properly tested. Call me picky.

This was purely an extra laptop for business/personal use. I went with the 13 inch i5 256GB version and it has been great so far! I wanted something smaller and more portable",""
"1860"," it starts to get a bit expensive. But if you have the money and you find the Surface Book 2 appealing"," then go for it!","","","","If you are looking for one for editing/gaming I would recommend going with the i7 1TB. Only problem is",""
"1861"," the hinge is much better on the Book 2 vs the 1st Gen Book"," and so far that seems to be the case. I have had this for about 5 weeks now"," and have not run into any major problems. So overall"," but the Book 2 is certainly a great choice!

I was looking forward to the release of the Surface Book 2 so I could upgrade to it. Buying one on the day it was released I am happy to say it is as great as I hoped. There is ONE small glitch that Microsoft should have corrected. On my Pro Tablets I was able to add a Micro Disc to add disc space. It tucked away neatly in the back of the tablet out of sight. On the Book it has a full size SDXC Card Reader. When you insert the card in it stick out about a half of an inch. I liked having the card so I could use it to save music or pictures and save the Hard Drive for apps. With the card sticking out I worry about bumping it and breaking it. I wish they would have designed it so it would go all the way in and sit flush against the body of the device.","","From what I read"," you just have to decide what is perfect for you"

I have docking station setup at home and in the office and this works fine. As a laptop it is somewhat heavier than I would like and as fitted with the keyboard I tend not to disconnect and use as a tablet. I guess these are my preferences and so are my limitationsi impose as much as they are criticisms of the hardware. Overall I am satisfied with the product and it fits the purposes I bought it for.

Checked the reviews by customers","Other than that it is fast"," which also keeps it quiet. The good battery life between charges is very good and the removable tablet is way better than a two in 1 that folds over. My model has the I5 processer"
"1865"," for better battery performance"," and I have to say that my HP Spectre shines in that area. In the three days that I've had my notebook"," I've gotten up to 11 hours of battery time"," which to me is phenomenal.

"1868"," I had tried the Dell XPS"," 2-1"," 15.6 laptop--gorgeous screen/graphics. The specs were great but the battery only lasted 5 hours and for a new machine that boasted up to 10 hours battery!

I have noticed"," though","Before I purchased the HP Spectre 360"," Cortana stopped working--gave me the silent treatment!

"1871"," I'm particular. If I'm going to spend good money then I want a machine that will deliver. The MacBook Pro"," sure it's top of the line"," but I didn't like the keyboard period"," same thing"," which I almost purchased but that machine was returned by another customer after having it for two-weeks. So I was leery about that. ASUS had 512 SSD plus 1TB of Hard Drive. Sounds impressive but eventually hard drives will become a thing of the past. So I'm immensely happy with my decision in getting the HP Spectre. So far"," nice audio but as I said"," and it's much too expensive. I prefer Windows-based machines anyway. Microsoft Surface looked good but some of the specs didn't impress me plus it was a screen size of 13.3 and I wanted 15.6. The cost was way too expensive for a smaller machine. I looked into an ASUS Vivo-Book"

The Spectre has the best backlit keyboard I've ever encountered and you can turn it off"," too"," unusual but okay. The adapter has a cylindrical connector and the charging time on that is pretty good. Pretty much all of the specs are right up my alley! It meets all my needs and that is what is important. This machine was not cheap either"," but I got a pretty good deal at Best Buy. In that vein","So short story long"," to save battery power. My laptop's color is dark ash silver--which is somewhat classy but kind of drab--looks more gray to me. No big deal. To turn on the machine you have to use the button situated on the left side"

"1877"," the battery is great.

"1878"," while you will not get the same 4K resolution as your big screen tv"," this laptop has the best screen i have seen"," even better than the Dell's 4k computer"," personally"," i don't like the fingerprint option because i think that extra effort to look for the fingerprint reader is time wasted"," colors are bright and stand out"," this computer lets you use Windows Hello via the face recognition or the fingerprint reader"
"1879"," the camera option would have you up and running. The only bad thing about this laptop is the fact it only comes with one USB type-A adapter"," which sucks"," and two thunderbolt adapter"," but this one does not come with that. I was under the impression the included pen was the one that charges with the thunderbolt port"," but it comes with the pen that uses AAAA baterry"," the two seconds it will take you to find it"," i believe HP has a Thunderbolt charger"
"1880"," i don't think this pen has the tilt option and i havent been able to set it up. the pen works right out of the box as no setting were required from me"," the pen itself has 2 buttons that can be customized with many options. It comes with a bag"," which is not expensive-looking"," my backpack has a computer compartment"," so i put the pouch that came with this laptop INSIDE my book bag compartment for extra padding. overall i am happy with this computer"," the pen feels light and nice to write with"," it will protect it from dust and scratches"
"1881"," the 13 inch version has a loud fan"," at this time"," my fan is running"," even 60% gives you enough brightness to continue working and prolonging life"," set your power setting to run the display at 70-80% for maximum battery and run it at 100% brightness on power"," get this version instead of the 13 inch one. from what ive been reading"," and i havent been able to hear it. this computer running at 80% brightness like i have it right now still looks gorgeous"
"1882"," but realistically who truly needs more than that? Surprisingly"," the 512gb SSD can be swapped out for 1TB or 2TB (according to Greek Squad) because it's not soldered in. Sadly"," the discrete video card is soldered in and cannot be replaced with a more powerful one---the only reason that matters is because this computer because of the video card will not support the Windows Virtual Reality goggles. The laptop is physically beautiful---it has gold hinges"," but sadly there is no place to put the pen--it's only a matter of time before I misplace it. I like the numeric keypad and the back-lit keys. The power brick is relatively small compared to other PC's I've had. I would have much preferred a 17 4K laptop"," but they don't exist. I find that the high quality becomes more apparent the more I use it--- this is only my second day of ownership"," YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED with this true beauty!

"1883"," considering it has a 15.6 screen. The speakers are the best I've ever encountered in a laptop. So far I've installed Band-in-a-Box 2018"," Chrome"," Dashlane"," and 64 bit Eclipse. This laptop was so new that BestBuy did not have a display model--- I bought it sight unseen based on the specs. Overall"," the only 2 negatives I have found is that it won't work with Microsoft Virtual Reality headset googles"," but it seems nicer today than it did yesterday. It's surprisingly small and thin"," 64 bit Java"
"1884"," the machine is heavier than a lightweight tablet but I rest it on my lap and the touch screen makes it a great feature for me. I have no regrets choosing a 15 machine over its smaller brother. The extra screen real estate is well worth it and the battery lasts through the day with my on and off usage. The Spectre also packs all the ports I need for peripherals. The only annoyance I have is that the touch pad is extremely sensitive and it often selects a link on a web page when I am simply trying to scroll down the page. I am very happy with the keyboard"," though"," and love the number pad which my old machine lacked. The speakers are great (I understand there are 4 on the machine) for a laptop of this size and I find them clear and quite loud when turned up. All in all I am very happy with this purchase.

A premium machined body in a beautiful dark ash color with just enough gold bling to make it look elegant and different. But it really is about performance. Cold startup in about 8 seconds and you are ready to go. That SSD is a huge step up from the hard drive on my previous machine and the face recognition logs you right in. I have to sign contracts from time to time and the touch screen and windows ink make it a breeze signing straight onto the screen. The tablet mode simplifies that task as well as I can fold it over and sign as if it were a piece of paper. A number of reviews have questioned the 2 in 1 capability of a 15 machine as they felt it was too large for this functionality. I can tell you that I have used tablet mode on a number of occasions and find it very convenient. Yes"," and smoothly talked me into buying this (and I needed a laptop very badly for an upcoming event)"
"1885"," as this laptop is basically only good for things like browsing the internet"," reading pdf and other simple stuff. you may ask why?","","","","I regret this decision very much now",""
"1886"," run codes and do school stuff. ","","","","","Because it gets overheated very easily! And then the customer service is there doing nothing. My main problem is that it gets very very hot when it is connected to a charger. Since this laptop has a 4k display that drains the battery fast. Now imagine what will happen since you cannot charge it and use it without the charger for long? you ended up using a hot frying pan to type your assignments",""

"1927"," you can easily slide it off a smooth surface on accident if you are not careful. Also"," the hinge doesn't lay flat if you push the screen back too far"," and it scratched my wood desk with the sharp edges near the hinge. Definitely needs to be placed on a pad when being used. Works okay overall"," but fortunately it has a touch screen as well for when the touchpad doesn't work. I plugged in a USB mouse and had the same issue. Battery life on a full charge is only 2-4 hours"," which has been probably the biggest disappointment so far. Even if I use the laptop for an hour"," but wish it had better grippers on the bottom"," but frequent glitches and very short battery life. Glitches include the screen freezing up or flickering in and out and the mouse touchpad functionality randomly turning on and off. It's annoying"

Recently"," I saw a sale on SSD's and so I bought one. The very next day (before installing the SSD) Windows froze up while using. I shut the computer down. Then the laptop would not boot up staying stuck on the ASUS logo screen. When I tried to repair or reset; NOTHING Worked. So"," I was told they could diagnose for free to see if it was a hardware or software issue.

"1944"," the laptop’s read speed surprisingly OUTPERFORMED the 840 PRO by a wide margin! (see attached results). The write speed of the laptop was lower"," but that’s not an issue as the read speed is what opens programs and keeps the computer running smoothly. In real-world terms: Is the laptop “snappy” when starting up and opening programs? YEP! Boot time is 14 seconds from power-on to the welcome screen and then maybe 30 more seconds for the system to fully boot and settle down after swiping the fingerprint scanner... I have a buncha little desktop gadgets (Addgadgets & Rainmeter) and 5 cloud drives + MS OneNote and MS Teams that start up with the system boot"," so that prolongs the startup time for all the gadgets and gizmos and drives to start up.

Since size almost never equates to speed"," and I downright despise those laptops that give me plenty of hard drive space but take five minutes to fully boot up","","","But this is only the half of it. While I could go on about the screen (it's certainly crisp"," something that I didn't know that came with the HP Envy 17 was a component that Intel calls Optane memory."
"2014"," the long story short is that Intel has finally beaten the slowness gap for conventional (non-SSD) hard drives by solving a fundamental problem. With exceedingly fast processors and RAM in abundance"," it has always been the case that hard drives were the slow spot. After all"," data has to get from hard drive to CPU and then to memory","","","While I always encourage folks to go find things out on their own"," and the highways that provide the access sometimes slow down more than a major-city Interstate at the height of rush hour."
"2015"," these components are tuned such that maybe 25% of the operating system's most-used activities act like an SSD. Again"," it's a perception issue and may not work for every situation"," but so far"," I can see almost no difference between 1 TB/16GB Optane and a purely SSD-based system operating on its own.","","Intel has decided to take some SSD RAM (essentially) and put 16GB (for one solution) between the hard drive and the CPU.

82,Lenovo - Yoga 730 2-in-1 13.3 Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - Platinum,Best All-Around Deal,Davis,3,5,I'm writing this review as someone who is extremely picky with their electronics"," wanting to get the best overall package. Firstly"," I really came close to getting a HP Spectre X360 the other day based on a lot of great reviews"," but the trackpad felt off to me and did not support all the gestures I wanted to use. That feature is a dealbreaker for me"," one for me"," I really like the Windows Precision Touchpad for the gestures which make working on the laptop feel nice. In fact"
"2034"," the keyboard works great too. For me"," it has the right combination of very solid feeling key presses with enough travel to feel satisfying while still feeling fast. That one is personal preference though; I think the new MacBook keyboards feel nice"," where some people hate them. Some keyboards throw me off with their layout"," bright/medium/off"," and unlike what I'm used to it's static. In other words"," so I'm glad this knocks it out of the park. The ability to swap desktops with a four finger swipe can help out when trying to do a lot on a smaller screen. To round out my comments on the inputs"," but this one feels good. One niggling annoyance...the backlighting has 3 levels"
"2035"," to reduce glare and distraction while watching a video. But"," that's just what I'm used to (coming from a Surface Pro 4). It's very quick to toggle though"," with function+spacebar","",""," if you're watching a video they will just stay illuminated all the time..I would rather the backlighting time out and turn off if you aren't touching the machine"," and the keyboard is natural enough that I usually don't need the light unless I'm using special characters. "
"2036"," and this machine feels really responsive. In CineBench R15"," I got a score of 714 after some tweaking for the CPU test. For comparison"," the MacBook Pro 13 is around 360 according to online tests. Some tasks may not show that difference"," which enables better battery and lower utilization of resources to watch videos"," compared to 6th gen or older. After years of incremental improvements (and some time spent with a noticeably less powerful machine) I felt that the 8th gen processor was a must. This is what knocked the MacBook Pro out of contention for me","Performance is something that I really missed coming from a Surface m3"," but in heavy workloads the new quad-core U-series processors are the first big step forward in some time for laptops this size. One feature I like is the hardware support for VP9 video codec used by Youtube"
"2037"," important in the future when 1tb or more NVMe drives are less expensive. Another factor in performance is cooling"," and this machine has a two fan cooling solution"," unlike the non-touchbar MBP. I saw temperatures spike high (never over safe limits) and then drop as the fans ramped up. They were very noticeable during intital setup"," however. Importantly down the road"," they're easily accessible for cleaning. Notably"," combined with its lack of features and high price of storage upgrades. Speaking of storage - getting a NVMe storage drive at this price is great. It helps the machine boot faster than my gaming desktop which itself is a beast. The drive is also user-replacable"," but I have not heard them much since. The noise is not too annoying"
"2038"," in most cases offering roughly similar performance due to themal or power limits. Finally for performance"," DDR4 ram is used instead of slower low-power DDR3 and the 802.11AC wifi worked well with my router delivering internet speeds the same as my desktop which is wired in (the wireless card is also upgradable to meet future standards"," if you were wondering).","",""," it seems like in laptops this size Core i7 is not a huge leap from Core i5",""
"2039"," I think they did a nice job. Once I removed the stickers"," it's a clean looking machine. I don't think it's anything that will realistically catch someone's eye and stand out"," but it's not priced like that either. The one standout design feature compared to older machines is the slim bezel display that is becoming popular. I think it looks great and while it's not the slimmest around (Dell XPS 13 takes that crown)"," but if you do use your webcam this is a selling feature. This laptop also features a fingerprint scanner"," which is a selling feature for me. My Surface had Windows Hello IR camera","For design"," it is slim enough to look nice and is the standout characteristic of the machine. I don't use the webcam much but the slightly larger top bezel allows it to be placed at a better angle which some laptops sacrifice for design. I wouldn't care"
"2040"," and better"," and in more conditions/wearing a hat/at odd angles. I would really miss this feature"," and MacBook Pro reserving it for the touchbar model is a bit of a bummer. Some sort of quick-login is a must"," with more than 4000 levels of pressure sensitivity. It's nice for taking notes"," drawing"," basically facial scanning. That worked well and I liked it. This works faster"," it's great to have. Another feature that this piles on is support for Wacom AES pens"
"2041"," having a normal USB port is something that will be nice"," I still have a lot of USB peripherals. It also supports always-on charging which is super handy. Funny"," but charging an iPhone with the included cord is something you can do on this machine"," so the convenience of your laptop charger also working for your phone is great. The included charger is 65w"," compared to some competitors 45w (Dell XPS 13) or 61w (MacBook Pro 13)"," or retouching photos. Another feature is fast-charge. The laptop only takes a little more than an hour to charge when it's off. Of course"," not on a MacBook. I have a USB-C phone"
"2042"," I haven't even touched on the 2 in 1 aspect"," which is another feature. It's not something I would use all the time"," but it's nice to have. The other models I was considering did not include this feature for the most part"," when you're getting it basically for free"," why not. Touch is another nice to have. I find it easier to use the great trackpad"," which helps the machine stay charging even when heavily taxed. Of course"," and I don't consider it a must have. However"
"2043"," the 2 in 1 flexibility is nice when you use it and you don't really pay a big price for it in money or functionality when you don't need it. There are 2 thunderbolt 3 ports if you want to dock the machine or add a graphics card externally in the future. This laptop also includes far-field microphones to let you use Cortana across the room as you can Alexa. I haven't tried those features.","","","",""," but for the drawing features or for space like on an airplane",""
"2044"," not great. The brightness is good"," but not as high as the more expensive options in the class. The glossy nature of the screen also invites glare more than I am used to. I haven't tried it outside"," but I would not expect it to do great in that setting. The battery is the same story. It's not as great as class leaders like the XPS and might be similar or a little less than a MacBook Pro 13. I've seen varying reports on what that machine can do. This one does use the more power hungry DDR4"," at a medium brightness setting. I have also seen it predict less when under load"," which they all do. But","Are there drawbacks to this machine compared to the competition? Yes. I think the screen is good"," which might explain some of it. I've seen around 6-7 hours though with video watching use and it seems to predict more for general web browsing"
"2045"," I think it helps make up for this. That said"," I think it's good enough for me. I would like XPS levels of 12+ hours"," but I understand this machine is much cheaper and with more features"," I sort of get it. Nothing is perfect. The build is great feeling especially settled on a table"," and premium"," with the fast charging"," so it's a trade off. Another good-not-great aspect is the speakers. They're loud enough but lack a real punch. Again"
"2046"," it can make a *very* slight creaking which I don't think MacBook Pro would do. Again"," a slight trade-off for a bottom panel that removes with screws in a straightforward manner for cleaning the fan or swapping battery"," SSD"," so it's a nitpick"," but I've nitpicked every machine I've looked at so I have to be fair. Finally the design"," and does not flex when picking up from a corner. That said"," or Wifi module. You sort of need to be looking for this issue"
"2047"," like in bed. It's not terrible"," but I could see improvements being made there. ","","",""," it is a little hard edged for my tastes in tablet mode or sometimes in my lap",""
"2048"," and a really great mix of features. For me"," it hits the must haves completely"," with enough nice-to-haves to surprise and delight. It says something that I was in the market for around ~$1000 machines and ended up with this one at a significant discount. I still like the XPS 13 but they seemed so close"," the HP Spectre X360 felt off in the touchpad which was a total dealbreaker"," and more flimsy than this unit. This laptop isn't perfect but in a crowded market really strikes me as a great deal","I think this laptop is greater than the sum of its parts"," it wasn't worth about $500 more for a similar configuration. The MacBook and Surface Laptop still lack the new processors which is strikes me slightly as lazy at this point when every other maker has them. Again"
"2049"," and the best fit for me. I don't usually make such a long review"," but I have been looking into every aspect of this class of laptop lately so I hope this helps someone. I do recommend it!

Seemed like a great device with the option to be able to use it as a tablet too. However after I had it 17 days (past the 15 return date) the battery wouldn't charge. Contacted support and they have me try new drives"," updating etc. When that doesn't work they tell me to mail it to their repair center. I told them no I spent over $1000 and that isn't going to happen as I use it for work and can't just send it out for repair. AND it is brand new I should not have to do that. So they charge me another $84.00 and someone will come to the house to fix it (I guess you get this option 1 time under warranty? not sure) Anyway they took my $84.00 8 days ago and still no one has shown up or contacted me to fix the battery. So I contacted them again yesterday to ask when someone is going to come fix it. Well seems they are out of the parts (what no batteries???) so i need to wait until they get the parts to have someone fix it. So here I sit attached to the wall when I want to use my brand new expensive Lenovo. Also no idea if when they fix it if it will actually be repaired correctly and work with no issues going forward. I should have probably bought a regular laptop from a different company as this one doesn't seem to care that a brand new machine has issues. So right now the way I am feeling about this probably won't buy their brand again in the future.

There doesn’t seem to be any weird layouts as far as where the keys are placed but Acer does use the Fn key for a lot of the hot keys you’d normally see specialized buttons for.

I pride myself on never using physical clicks on the trackpad anyways and typically stow away a mouse in my travel bag anyways.","","","The laptop itself looks good to the eye.

There’s also a slot for a SATA drive if you wanted to add storage for games (I’d take care if doing it yourself as the SATA connector is on a ribbon cable and they’re very fragile.)

2,Acer - Nitro 5 15.6 Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti - 256GB Solid State Drive - Shale Black,BEST Entry level gaming laptop!!,dlowen,0,5,I will start out this review by saying this laptop blew my expectations. Since this is on the cheaper end of gaming laptops I was expecting to notice that in performance or design.  ","","","","","I was extremely happy with the power and speed of this laptop. It’s ability to sit in the lap and work as a productivity machine without fatiguing my lap",""
"2165"," my biggest complaint about the keyboard is how all of the functions such as changing the volume or brightness require you to hold down the function key and then press each function. They do not have their own dedicated keys like on most laptops and they are spread out throughout the keyboard. I found it to be time consuming and a hassle to change any of these settings. I can normally type without looking at the keyboard but on this laptop every time I would hit the backspace key I kept hitting the number lock key on the 10 key. The track pad works decent but I would recommend getting a mouse to use while gaming or working on it. The screen is full HD and offers great colors. It is one of the better screens I have seen on a laptop. Another great thing about the screen is that it is anti-reflective which in my opinion makes a huge difference. As far as ports I wish that the two 2.0 USB ports were 3.0 but it does have one 3.0 and a Type C port. It is nice that it includes all of these ports because it is compatible with both old and new technology without needing a bunch of dongles. ","","","","","The design of this laptop is much different than other gaming laptops that exists. It is much thinner and lighter than others. It has some lines and the red black color scheme but other than that it is a lot closer to a regular laptop. It is also not as bulky and heavy. It still comes in at just under 6 pounds so it is hefty compared to some modern day ultra-books. Part of the reason that it is so cheap is because it is made out of a lot of plastic. The plastic can make it feel a little less premium but I still love its design. The keyboard has red backlighting which I am personally a fan of. In addition the WASD keys are outline with read so that they can easily be found during gaming. The keys are extremely quiet when typing and there is little feedback. After some time you get used to typing on it but a little more feedback and travel would be nice. One complaint is how close together the keys are. However",""
"2166"," better"," and faster technology comes out. A lot of laptops are getting to a point where everything is soldered onto the mother board. With as fast as technology becomes outdated it is important that you can update your laptop with new technology. It was an extreme surprise to me that there was room in the Hard drive bay to add an extra 2.5 in HDD or SDD for more storage. This was nice because it only has 256gbs of storage so it would be easy to throw in an extra drive for more storage. You can also easy access the memory where you can fit two sticks of DDR 4 laptop RAM. I also decided to dig deeper and pull off the entire bottom of the laptop. It comes off easily if you remove all the screws. This was extremely helpful especially if you wanted to clean out the dust on the inside of the laptop. From here I found the internal SSD. To my surprise it was an m.2 PCIe SSD. This means that it can be replaced with something like a Samsung EVO 960 SSD. This can be a fairly cheap upgrade to much faster and larger storage. So this laptop not only allows you to add a SATA drive but you can also replace the internal SSD because it is not soldered to the motherboard.  ","","","","The next thing I would like to cover is upgradability. Every year newer",""
"2167"," the components that it comes with performed amazingly. The new 8th generation Intel I5-8300H performed extremely well. I was a little weary about gaming on an i5 instead of i7 but it had no problem at all. In fact it is most likely faster than some i7s. The ram at 8gbs seemed to be enough although I will eventually upgrade to 16 and it can support up to 32! The SSD is one of the fastest that exists and the only downside of it is that its only 256 gbs but still plenty. The graphics card is also one of the better ones and came handy while gaming. It was able to handle Fortnite on Epic settings without any issues. One thing to think about while gaming is keeping your computer cool. This laptop has an awesome cooling system and great ventilation. Even after gaming for an hour or more on it I never really even heard the fans kick up to high. NitroSense is an awesome program that it comes pre-installed with that allows you to adjust the fan settings. There is no doubt that this laptop can handle any of today’s popular games with the hardware that it comes with. Last part of performance is battery life. It is not expected to have all day battery life as it is a gaming laptop but if you are on the go and not gaming you can get 4-5+ hours depending on your settings. For the power it has to offer I would not complain about the battery life.  ","","","","","Last and possibly most importantly is performance. This PC was built for gaming and in order to handle games the hardware must be very good. Although the internal components can be upgraded to better and faster ones",""
"2168","","","","","","Overall I think this is a great laptop. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to get into gaming but is on a budget. Right out of the box it can handle games and down the road it would be very easy to upgrade the internals making it that much better. There are a couple flaws in the design but they are nothing major that should stop anyone from buying this laptop. I do not think there is any other laptop on the market in this price range that is performing this well. In addition to gaming it would be a great laptop for anyone needing a lot of processing power for business such as video or photo editing.

"2369"," the Nitro 5 isn’t overly heavy or large. At first glance"," it is roughly the size and weight of traditional laptops of just a few years ago meaning it is still plenty portable. The top case is a dark grey/light black faux brushed metal panel which looks surprisingly understated compared to other gaming laptops. The logo is a standard Acer logo and the only hint this might be a different laptop is the strip of red on the hinge. Even once open the palm rest is a satin black finish"," which attracts fingerprints","","","If this is your first look into a gaming laptop be prepared. After seeing all these ultra-thin and light laptops you will find the focus on gaming laptops is on performance before size. You can only squeeze so much power into the ultra-thin chassis. That said"," with black keys with red letters. The WASD keys and trackpad have a bolder outline of red. The backlight covers all the red accents except strangely the trackpad. The only options are on and off. Without the backlight on you could bring this to work and it would be unlikely anyone would realize it’s a gaming laptop. Overall it is a nice touch for those who want a system that can pull double duty."
"2370"," the responsiveness and accuracy is quite good. Spacing is also very good allowing you to quickly find the precise key you want with good separation between keys. This does not carry over to the number pad on the right. The function keys at the top and the number pad keys are both very cramped. If you are playing games that make heavy use of the function keys or arrow keys"," you might find a challenge to quickly choose the one you want. If you are one of those rare people who can game with a trackpad you will find yourself both happy and a little frustrated. The trackpad has the precision and responsiveness of a precision touchpad but unfortunately if you try to use that in combination with the WASD keys you will find they are nearly stack one on top of the other. Since most people use a separate mouse for gaming and typically for other uses the touchpad is best in the center this shouldn’t affect most and for other cases it works very well. Palm rejection could use a little refinement but is still very good.","","","","This double duty continues onto the design of the keys of the keyboard. They are chicklet style keyboard that makes very little sound. This is helpful when you are in a quiet meeting but it does lend to a soft feel compared to Cherry MX or other mechanical switches. It might take some adjustment but if you can get over the feeling",""
"2371"," but newer titles will likely take some tweaking to make them playable. The other slowdown comes in the form of the 5400 traditional hard drive and only 8GB memory. The good news is that both are upgradable via access panels on the bottom of the chassis. If you really want to risk voiding your warranty"," there is also an M.2 slot underneath the bottom panel but unfortunately according to HWInfo64 there are no spare PCIExpress lanes available means an NVME SSD shouldn’t be compatible"," but you can still use a SATA based SSD without a problem if you are up to the surgery. The system is compatible with Intel Optane RST but unfortunately since the wrong parts were used you can’t take advantage to speed up the slow hard drive on the cheap. With this slow hard drive you will find that system startup and of course games loads are slow. You will also find that with the 8GB of ram the hard drive gets easily get maxed out causing some frustrating lags. Yes","","","Since this is a budget gaming laptop the big question is where is the big sacrifice? If you are looking at this system you already know the performance of the Geforce 1050. Older games are playable with all settings maxed out"," this can be fixed with upgrades later but be prepared for the occasional lag. Once things are loaded in memory usage is quick in most cases."
"2372"," even with fans configure to Max speed and even with CoolBoost enabled the Core i5 was able to get up as high as 197 degrees. According to the specs on the processor"," the max temp is 200 degrees"," so it came extremely close to thermal throttling even with all cooling settings used. The GPU ran cooler","","","During testing with 3D bench the surprise was that the gaming bottleneck wasn’t the slow hard drive or limited RAM but it was actually the GeForce 1050. Processor based tests faired decent but during stress testing of the GPU the system was only to pull off 11FPS. This doesn’t mean the processor can’t potentially slow you down. During stress testing"," but oddly the GPU the temps kept dropping off the monitor. The good thing is you want to run the fans at max speed to allow max cooling the sound should not bother you. The fans are most certainly audible but only as an air rushing sound. No bearing whine or other unpleasant sounds could be heard. This is quite impressive since some other high-end systems introduce a high-pitched bearing whine at full speed."
"2373"," the speakers are respectably loud on hard surfaces. Since they are downward firing any use on other surfaces will muffle the sound and make them far less useful. Combine that with the fan noise and a good set of gaming headphones are in order. Regardless"," gaming headphones are the better way because of the distinct advantage of immersion and sound placement. The build in speakers seem more designed for casual use rather than gaming which is understandable for any portable gaming rig and more so in a budget one.","","","","Continuing with the fan noise",""
"2374","","","","","","Battery life is always a sore point for gaming systems and the Nitro 5 is somewhere in the middle of the pack on this. Integrated Intel graphics mean that during light usage the GeForce goes to sleep and the system sips power but considering all that is crammed into the system you can get at best 5 to 5 ½ hours of light to moderate use. Gaming on battery power is expectedly much shorter and variable depending on the game.",""
"2375"," and budget gaming laptops have a harder time since they must decide what to compromise to keep the price down. Although the Nitro 5 most certainly has compromises"," it seems Acer did a good job of choose what to compromise to keep the price in check and made an overall good system with some upgrade options. If the Core i5 and GeForce 1050 do not meet your initial requirements"," you are best off looking towards the higher end Nitro 5 from the start as those two components are not upgradeable. If you don’t need the most powerful gaming laptop available and just would like some modest upgrades while saving money this one could be for you.

"2387"," but like it over the 256GB NVMe SSD option because of the storage required for a library of games. I recognize that external hard drives (and especially USB-C ones) exist and can alleviate this quite easily"," but there's nothing more convenient than having access to more games without worrying about more attachments. From a performance perspective"," aside from slower boot times and possibly slower game load times"," if you wanted to buy an additional SSD and add it to this machine"," you could do that pretty easily and with limited impact to your wallet. (Not that you want to buy a machine just to upgrade it","First and foremost--I had a few concerns about the spinning hard drive"," the spinning hard drive did the job fine…but"
"2388","","","","",""," but that still puts you under $850 after upgrade).",""
"2389"," choosing your graphics card is something that you have to decide up front. The Nitro 5 comes with either the 1050 or the 1050Ti"," the latter being the better performer"," but I found the 1050 to do an adequate job at processing video without stutter or lag. And"," it pushed 60FPS consistently without fail every time I played. Just upgrading to the model with the 1050 Ti and keeping the spinning hard drive adds only $30"," so if you're looking to squeeze every bit of juice out of this it's almost certainly worth the investment.","And while the hard drive is a decision that you don't have to stick with long-term"," not that Rocket League is the most video-intensive game"
"2390"," this is easily upgradable to a max of 32GB"," but as with the lower-spec graphics card I didn't see any performance lags during gameplay running with only 8GB. And the display was good"," not great. On a budget gaming machine"," so there's not much here that is a surprise.","","RAM was another big concern of mine; fortunately"," I wasn't expecting much here--decent viewing angles and got the job done; a 4K display would have too drastic an impact on price tag and performance"
"2391"," the design is one that I found to be pretty attractive and not too overstated. Gaming peripherals and PC cases and monitors and the various other gaming-related gadgets are usually far too gaudy for my liking"," but the Nitro 5 does a good job balancing the traditional red gaming components with an almost stealthy look for the rest of the device. The keyboard was good"," although I don't like the backlighting at all"," although I would imagine most folks would be connecting an external mouse to this during long-term use.","","Stepping away from the specs"," as the backlights are more visible from the front of the device (with light bleeding out from beneath the keys) than it is on the keycaps themselves. I feel like this is a design flaw--making the keycaps just a bit taller can cover up these lines of light and add to the stealthy profile.

But for someone like me"," a not-so-serious gamer that wants to occasionally play some PC games","","","There are a couple final points to make in this review. First"," I think this machine is a really good choice. I think the intense gamers will probably be dissatisfied with something like this unless they're looking specifically for a mobile-friendly rig to complement their already awesome home-built PC."
"2394"," there is a fair amount of competition at this price point. I would fully expect a little bit of a discount for the entry-level"," budget-conscious gaming laptop"," so keep your eyes out for that. Specs will all be about the same","","","Second"," so it may come down to price or design that makes you pull the trigger."
"2395"," if you're not a gamer but plan to get serious about it"," I wouldn't spend the money here. There's a lot of draw to having a gaming laptop"," but in most cases"," you can build a pretty great starter machine that will be far more customizable and upgradeable for you in the years to come.","","Third"," you're going to be playing in one place--and at $700"
"2396"," given that the Nitro 5 is available in a few different configurations (swapping out the spinning drive for an SSD or the GTX 1050 for a slightly-more-capable GTX 1050Ti)"," figure out where you think you'll get the best bang for your buck and go for it. I think the sweet spot is probably the better graphics card with the larger hard drive"," but that's entirely subjective. ","","","But all that considered--I had a lot of fun with this machine.

Ultimately"," it has a great wide screen"," in real life) than one of my ultraportable laptops with detachable keyboard"
"2411","","","","",""," this results in a good bottom line which price conscious buyers will appreciate.",""

I installed all the Microsoft Windows updates and for some reason it did not patch the problem on my device. I promptly returned it to Best Buy for a full refund. I then found the same item from Microsoft on a Black Friday discount and figured a product directly from them would be patched already. The Surface Pro I got from the Black Friday sale on Microsoft came with a keyboard which was a savings of another $150. I love the product and if the patch had worked I would not have returned it. The one I got from Microsoft themselves doesn't have the random hibernation issue. I would recommend this product to any digital artist. Just be mindful that you will have to install the updates before using because there is the random hibernation issue that the updates will patch.

The 15” Dell XPS has a beautiful 4K screen but its keyboard had tiny keys with minimal travel. Battery life on the XPS was also challenging and the vents on the bottom were easily blocked when using on my lap. The latest 15” MacBook Pro is nice"," but the keyboard had even less travel than the XPS and it just wasn’t comfortable to use for long periods of time. At one point I even tried the original 13” Surface Book (i5 8 GB RAM 256 GB SSD w/ dGPU). I wanted so badly to like it"," but the 13” screen just wasn’t enough to make it my daily driver.

The extra screen real estate of the 15” screen is worth the money. I was worried it would be too bulky or unwieldy",""

8,Lenovo - 330S-15IKB 15.6 Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Platinum Gray,Excellent bang for the buck,JohnIV,0,5,This is a great lappy for the price. There is nothing quite like it in the price range $450-$500. Purchased for my father"," the main pros are the SSD/memory and the CPU combo. 8th gen i5 and 128GB of storage and 8GB RAM. It's sturdily constructed"," very thin and light compared to other 15-ers in its class. Was able to strip the bloatware easily"," this was the best bang for the buck at its price point and I'm very pleased with how quick and responsive it is. Recommended.
11,Lenovo - 330S-15IKB 15.6 Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB Solid State Drive - Platinum Gray,Great for the Price,kaz3320,0,4,This is one of the better budget laptops within the price range. I've checked the specs of all the other laptops (6/15/18) and this one was the better of the bunch. Thanks to AMD's competitive Ryzen processors"," Intel was forced to step up their game so now this i5 is a quad-core processor. The display is essentially similar to a 720p screen which is a bit disappointing. It contains 8GB of ram so it can handle a fair amount of concurrent applications running. It also has a 128GB SSD so the computer is able to boot up as well as load applications really fast. The only downside to this is the storage size since it's a small 120GB. The operating system takes up about 30GB so you're left with around 90GB of storage to use.","All things considered"," unlike the other reviewer I let the McAfee uninstall finish after it paused at 50%. The SD reader will be put to use; unfortunate that you have to use a full size SD adapter that will stick out instead of a dedicated micro-SD like you can get w/ the Surface line. Only compromise to speak of is the lack of touch screen and the somewhat low resolution. Not an issue for my dad's setup as he will drive an external larger monitor with this.

I just couldn’t recommend this to artists because of the pen experience isn’t up to par"," but if you’re someone who has used MPP and loves it"," there’s also no right CTRL button. Don’t forget to do your research though. I heard that Lenovo just released the YOGA 730"," which has almost similar specs but a 4GB GTX 1050 and a Wacom ActiveES display.

I bit the bullet and doubled my money to buy this puppy. Long story short I do not regret it!","I’d say the Best Buy exclusive Q535UD"," go ahead and get this. As long as you don’t mind some misses with the build quality and being plugged most of the time and just a reminder"
"2903"," portable"," and powerful specs that looked to be perfect for college. When I brought it home I had nothing but issues with it"," from the flimsy screen to the miserable 20 megabit max wifi speed; It's only saving grace was the battery. The ASUS is everything the HP tried to be and then some.","","","What originally attracted me to the previous laptop was the lightweight",""
"2904"," something I worried about with the HP. I love the fact the keyboard back lighting has an adjustable brightness level"," something the HP lacked and was often too bright in a dark room. I found the keys to be very quiet even after slamming them while panicking to submit my finals. The OS is installed on the SSD so it's very quick and snappy"," another huge victory over my previous pick"," clear"," and I really enjoyed using the screen for creative purposes more than I expected. The screen didn't have any issues with pressing on it and making a ripple effect and wasn't wobbly in any of the 'modes'. The hinges are really solid and fold in such a way it creates a flush edge so it looks very expensive and attractive. I absolutely love this laptop and it's as close to perfect as it gets for me!","This ASUS laptop is basically all metal and it feels extremely high quality and durable and I don't worry about it being squished in my carrying bag"," and the additional 2TB was just icing on the cake. The screen appears to be true 4K (3840 x 2160) and everything is incredibly crisp"
"2905"," disabled all the pretty effects"," and just tried to maximize my overall battery while trying to keep the features I paid premium for like the 4K screen and pen. I get roughly 5-6 hours doing casual Firefox browsing and roughly the same or maybe less actively using Visual Studio but I'll be honest I usually keep it plugged in before I lose my work. There is some icky bloatware that is easy to get rid of and it's pretty annoying but it's a ton better than HP's. The touch pad is something I have to get use to coming from a desktop back to the portable world but it's nothing a wireless mouse cannot fix. The keyboard backing does have a little flex if you give some pressure but it's very rigid overall. When you use this laptop for a decent amount of time or using a lot of intensive programs there is a tad bit of heat that comes from the bottom. The fan placement isn't the best and it's suggested not to leave it in tablet mode for too long because of it. Lastly"," the beautiful metal finish tracks finger prints extremely easy so if that bothers you maybe grab a lid cover or something to clean it after use. ","","","Now for the short list of bad things. The biggest trade off for all the amazing specs in this little bugger is battery life. I turned off all background apps",""

I haven't used the pen that it comes with that much","I would like to end this by saying that if you are used to android or apple tablets then you might find the windows tablet mode a little difficult to get used to and might not like it but if you give it time then eventually you will get used to it enough that you can do everything the other's do just a little differently"," so I was a little hesitant with a 13 inch laptop. Even though 2 inches doesn't sound like a big difference I have noticed it in a very positive way. I love that I can easily take this Spectre to work and back home without any issues carrying it"

However","Okay"," reviewing for about 2 months prior to making a purchase. The MSI GS65 kept yelling at me"
"3023"," I was talked into buying the Microsoft Surface Book 2 (SB2 moving forward) as I was told it would be better for both productivity and gaming.

Well"," the whites are white and there are a multitude of options to change the colors"," brightness","I am the type that really needs / requires a bright and vibrant screen. The whites to be white and not washed out"," then I get it home and my worst fears were NOT realized. The colors are beautiful"
"3025"," vibrancy and color representation? No"," but it certainly holds it own for a 1080P screen. The 144HZ more than makes up for it to say the least. I can no longer go back to a 60HZ screen after this. Thanks"," MSI for ruining me in that way!","",""," etc. MSI True Color works very well. Does it compare to the SB2 as far as clarity",""
"3026"," I tried several games. GTA V I was getting 35 - 55 FPS on normal (medium) settings and on the SB2"," I am getting between 90-130 FPS on mostly high settings on the GS65.

Forza 7 via Windows 10 gaming","","","Performance: Again in comparing SB2's performance to the GS65"," 60FPS on the SB2 and 144HZ on the GS65. Ridiculous!"

"3031"," but the volume doesn't get loud at all. Not sure why that is"," but in some programs I have to turn the volume up to 80 and that's a little odd. Perhaps a driver issue"," I don't know.","","","2. The speakers sound so-so",""
"3032"," it makes it quite risky and certainly a pain in the patootie to do so. Yes"," I said patootie.

That being said"," this review embodies my true thoughts about this laptop.","","","In conclusion",""
"3084","","","","","","Backstory:",""
"3085"," the Asus Zephyrus GM501"," the Gigabyte Aero 15x and of course the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. I ultimately decided on the Stealth Thin for its more subdued"," professional look"," and manufacturer’s support(read: support from the manufacturer if something breaks in the laptop)","","I’m an incoming college freshman who needed a new laptop for college work. I like to play games and previously played on a PS4. I needed a laptop and couldn’t take my PS4 with me so I decided I wanted to get something that would let me jump into the PC gaming world. I researched for several months looking for the best laptop that would let me play top games at ultra settings. I also wanted something that would be thin and light enough that I could take it to class with me. I had pretty much narrowed my search down to the Razer Blade 15"," price point"
"3086","","","","","","My First Experience:",""
"3087"," like GTA V and Far Cry 5 for example. I was immediately notified by the other members using the wifi that I had completely cut them off from receiving bandwidth. I had somewhat shrugged it off"," assuming that everything would be fine after the large download was done. Once it was done"," I hopped on to GTA with a buddy and tried talking with him on Discord using my wired headset I already owned. I plugged it in using the appropriate splitter necessary to use both input and output. He was unable to hear me"," then ultimately the sound settings in Windows"," I was getting no feedback from my mic","The first time I took home the Stealth Thin I was pumped to download some games that could test it"," sure enough after going into the Discord settings"
"3088"," updating and reinstalling drivers for anything sound and microphone related"," boosting the microphone levels"," plugging in and trying different headsets"," this is where I ran into more internet related problems. Using Ookla I was able to test at a couple mbps down and about one mbps up"," all while causing everyone else using the wifi to be booted off the network as well. I knew I wasn’t using all the bandwidth as I was only getting a couple mbps and I pay for and regularly get over 100 mbps. Granted"," but I was still able to hear all audio just fine. I later went through all the troubleshooting I could think of"," the whole nine yards. It was a very frustrating week or so... I decided to just play anyways to test the very expensive piece of hardware I just bought. The game ran great at ultra settings outputting well over 60fps. Same went for Far Cry 5 which ran similarly well. However"
"3089"," my router had never experienced any previous problems"," even with 5 iPhones"," 3 iPads"," I also experienced a loose and creaky panel right in front of the trackpad(between the user and the trackpad). Anytime my finger or anything would touch it"," it would give a little and make a popping/clicking noise. This was a little disappointing as I just paid $2000 for a laptop that I hadn’t even had for a week and it already was showing signs of wear after sitting on a desk for approximately a week"," this issue could have been a result of my router incorrectly sending all the bandwidth to my laptop as it thought I needed more because I was still getting slow speeds on my laptop. However"," 2 PS4s and 2 computers all connected and simultaneously using the internet. Back to the laptop itself"
"3090","","","","",""," not having even been moved.",""
"3091","","","","","","Lucky Return:",""
"3092"," I noticed that it was now on sale for $150 less than what I had bought it for. I lucked out and realized that that it was the last day I could take the laptop in and get a price adjustment. I decided that I would further push my luck and take it into the Geek Squad to see if they could fix my microphone jack issues or even better: give me a new replacement. The gentleman at Geek Squad was very nice and understanding about my concerns with the laptop. He tried to fix it for a while and then did ultimately come up with some kind of halfway fix but it wasn’t perfect. He offered me the choice of getting a new laptop and starting over or just keeping my same one. I gladly accepted the new laptop and he was even able to give me the price adjustment. I felt super lucky to have been able to not only get another laptop but also receive the $150 off of the laptop as well just before the return period was up. The Geek Squad/Best Buy service was great when I came in with this issue.","","","","","While I was trying to look around to see if anyone else had issues with not being able to use a mic in the Best Buy reviews",""
"3093","","","","","","My Second(and much better) Experience:",""
"3094"," it was wayyyy better. It still sucked up quite a bit of bandwidth while downloading the large games"," but once it was done and doing normal"," less intensive tasks"," even as I have carried it with me to class several times now. I must have just received a bad laptop the first time as this one that I currently have now works as it should.","","This time when I took the laptop home"," I had no issues. The microphone jack actually worked right out of the box! And so far(fingers crossed) I have not encountered any clicking of the panel below the trackpad"
"3095","","","","","","The Laptop:",""
"3096"," it runs games really well and switches between dedicated and integrated graphics flawlessly when playing games and doing general productivity tasks as it should. The temps are generally pretty fair"," peaking at high 80s to low 90s under full loads(my first laptop did encounter a bit of throttling capped at about 95 under load"," this has not occurred yet with my second laptop). The fans can get a little noisy under load but do not whine or shriek. They are just about inaudible while just doing normal tasks. They are also easily blocked out by even a decent pair of headphones though. The screen of this laptop is actually pretty nice"," but I found the high refresh rate to be great and it seems to accurately display colors as well. I absolutely love the thin bezels this screen has and the bezels were actually one of the reasons I chose this laptop over some of the others. I also really like the keyboard. The keys feel springy and make a satisfying noise. The lighting options and customizability with the SteelSeries Engine 3 app are very fun too. I sort of wish that there was a number pad"," but then the whole layout and spacing of the keys would be different and I like being able to type on a pretty regularly sized keyboard","Now finally onto my actual thoughts on the laptop itself. I really like this laptop"," I’m not super picky about screens"
"3097"," which isn’t necessarily a bad thing"," but the amount of force it takes to click if you aren’t pushing near the very bottom is pretty high. This also makes it really hard to drag and drop anything too. This isn’t a huge deal to me though as I usually use a mouse anyways but I thought it did deserve a mention. Onto the ports"," I feel like the Stealth Thin has a great selection of ports with 3 USB type A"," a mini displayport"," an HDMI port"," so it is a tradeoff you have to make with this size of laptop. The trackpad is not my favorite… It seems to track my movements fairly well and the size and look of the trackpad is nice as well. But where it really suffers a bit is clicking. You have to click the actual trackpad itself as there aren’t any dedicated mouse buttons"," a thunderbolt 3 enabled USB C"
"3098"," the power port and even a gigabit ethernet port. I feel like they maybe should have included a SD card reader as this laptop looks somewhat professional and many professionals like to transfer files on SD cards but it doesn’t really bother me as I use flash drives more. Now for a little bit about the inside. You can easily find what this laptop is made of but I do want to clarify a few quirky things. This special Best Buy edition has a 512 GB SATA ssd. This is still super fast to me as I previously have only used hdd but I feel it should be mentioned as this laptop does have two(one empty) M.2 slots. The 512 GB ssd is partitioned into one drive with about 280 GB and another drive with about 175 GB. I’m sure you can take out the partition with 3rd party software but I could not unpartition it myself using just the windows software. This actually turned out to not be a huge deal as I just linked my Steam library to span across both “drives”. Lastly"," I’ll talk about the exterior of the laptop. While I love the sharp look of the black and gold/copper accents"," the black metal casing really picks up oil from fingerprints. It’s easily cleaned and wiped down but it does acquire fingerprints pretty quickly. As for the build quality"," but it’s not a Macbook. It’s very thin and light for a legitimate gaming laptop so obviously you have to make a few sacrifices. ",""," an audio in jack and an audio out jack"," I’m satisfied with my second laptop. It’s not flimsy"
"3099","","","","","","Overall:",""
"3100"," if I had gotten my second laptop the first time around it would be an easy 5 stars. It’s a very powerful and sleek looking machine that destroys pretty much any task you throw at it. I would definitely recommend this laptop to any gamer out there.

I’m not sure if I would have been able to say the same with the first one I had but I’m very glad that Best Buy let me exchange mine. The sub-par quality of the first laptop is the only reason I took off a star",""
"3101","","","","","","Build Quality & Design:",""
"3102"," which is one of the best aspects of this laptop. For a 15.6 laptop"," it feels relatively as heavy as an iPad pro with a type cover attached - that is to say"," not very heavy. The trade off to this is that the laptop does have some flex in certain areas. The display does flex slightly when opening and there is some slight flex over the vent above the keyboard. However in everyday use it's not noticeable (how often do you really just press down on random areas of the chassis of your laptop..?). There is little-to-no flex in the keyboard or palm rests. ","","","The chassis appears to be a very thin aluminum. This allows the laptop to be incredibly lightweight",""
"3103"," school"," or at most individual's office space and not feel as though all eyes are judging. The gold dragon is the only thing that clues this as being a little different than your run-of-the-mill laptop"," and it looks more elegant than gaudy. The keyboard however does have an eclectic font typeface. However"," neither good nor bad. I personally find the font to be fun and I enjoy it. The keyboard comes with RGB lighting which can be customized or disabled as you prefer. The quality of the lighting is superb"," and seems on par with Razer's Chroma. ","The design is superb. The design is very nice and subdued. It's something you can take out in a coffee shop"," this is a completely subjective aspect of the laptop"
"3104"," it's beautiful. The brightness is somewhere between standard and great. It's not the brightest screen"," but it definitely does well for daily use. As far as screen bleeding"," this is easily the first laptop screen I've owned that has absolutely NO screen bleed (seriously!)"," but I'm very happy with this display. The 144hz refresh rate also allows for snappy performance and looks great - particularly when scrolling through extensive word and excel documents. Text doesn't blur together"," it remains crisp. ","As far as the display"," which is a massive 5 star to MSI. I don't know if I hit the display lottery"
"3105","","","","","","Performance:",""
"3106"," I can't speak much to the power of the i7-8750H as I don't do any photo or video editing. However"," I can comment about the GPU. The GTX 1070 is of the max-q variant"," meaning it is approximately 10-15% slower than the standard mobile 1070. This is a good thing as it allows the computer to run cooler and have better battery life without significant drop in performance. This laptop will shred through most modern AAA titles at 70+ FPS at 1080p resolution (I can't speak on 4K gaming). The thermals are also good"," MSI has done a good job. With three exhaust vents (two on the sides"," one in the back)","Unfortunately"," for a laptop this size. You have to compromise a little when it comes to thermals. Small packages cannot deliver low temperatures. However"
"3107"," the laptop stays relatively cool while gaming both internally and to the touch over the keyboard and palm rests. The fans do kick on during serious gaming"," but the sound is a lower"," less distracting"," but likely be okay with it. ",""," there is plenty is space to dispel the heat. There are also two large air intake vents on the top and bottom of the keyboard. As a result"," whirling sound. You'll notice it"
"3108","","","","","","Battery:",""
"3109"," the battery during normal operation is phenomenal. Combinations of web browsing"," YouTube"," listening to music"," I average between 6-10 hours (depending on what all I have open). Gaming is substantially less - around 1 hour to 4 hours (depending on the game). You'll want your charger if you plan on gaming for hours on end. ","","This is one of the big selling points to me. For such a powerful laptop"," and working in Microsoft office programs"
"3110","","","","","","Other:",""
"3111"," you'll likely be using headphones anyways which makes it a non-issue. If you don't have headphones"," go get a pair. The built in audio drivers are pretty good with headphones. The touchpad uses windows precision drivers and is very responsive. It's a little smaller than something like the macbook pro or surface book"," but I never found that I ran out of space during normal use. It's positioned more on the left side of the laptop which is nice for typing (as your palm doesn't brush up against it)"," it's not a deal breaker at the least"," just something I've noticed. If you plan on doing a lot of mouse intense work","Audio is good. Laptop speakers are almost always awful. These are pretty good for simple YouTube and movie watching. If you're seriously into gaming or are an audiophile"," but can be uncomfortable to use for an extended period of time as your right hand has to bend sideways more. Yet again"
"3112"," regardless of the laptop. There are no biometric login features"," so no Windows Hello or fingerprint. However"," I find that a quick 4 digit pin number unlocks just as quick as it takes for most Windows Hello equipped laptop's infrared cameras to kick on.","",""," you'd likely want a mouse anyways",""

"3183"," and it arrived triple-boxed. The innermost"," MSI-branded box contained the laptop (in two protective sleeves).

"3184"," however I haven't noticed anything during normal use. This is most likely due to MSI designing around weight - it's very light for a 15.6'' screen"," at 4.1 lbs / 1.9 kg.

"3185"," I adore the black and gold look"," with only the individually-lit RGB keyboard to suggest a gaming pedigree (this was easily set to a uniform white through the SteelSeries Engine software - Fn-1-0 acts as a shortcut to jump between different profiles). The keyboard is lovely to type on with a good medium weight to each key - I very quickly found myself making no more mistakes than I would on any other I'm used to using. The 1080p screen is reasonably bright with a high 144 Hz refresh rate and a good colour range (however if this is important for your own work I would advise checking the many technical reviews which calibrate the colours according to the 3 standards). The trackpad (running Synaptic drivers) was annoying at first however"," it seemed to enter a click every 7 seconds or so losing focus on any drop down menus.

"3188"," but the Max-Q 1070 has been performing well on benchmarks and I have no real concerns here. The 8th generation of intel CPUs seem to perform around 30% better than the previous generation"," and the USB-3 thunderbolt port offers the potential to run an external GPU if that becomes relevant in years to come. The main concern is the thermals - at high loads users have found this model to run hot!

I also forgot to mention Asus also include a nice keychain lanyard in the box with some stickers.

"3627"," the laptop itself is thinner than the diameter of a dime; if you set the laptop and a dime on a level table"," the laptop is a shade thicker because it has rubber pads that elevate it off of the surface. It is also very light. It fits well in my standard backpack and it does not feel noticeably heavier than the school-issued Chromebook I carried around this past school year. The power brick on the cord is also smaller than I expected for a gaming laptop (6 x 2 7/8 x 7/8 inches). It fits nicely for transportation. ","","","","Size: This laptop is thin. Really thin. For perspective",""
"3628"," but the issues were not related to the laptop at all. Other reviews complain of bloatware"," but what they really are complaining about is the default Windows 10 applications.

After hours of research and restoring backups"," I simply downloaded the latest Intel Internal Graphics Card Drivers and everything was working perfectly. After that","Set-Up: The set-up process was actually relatively frustrating for me and my dad"," which allows you to montior your system and is the performance center.

","","","","","Outward Appearace: I'm happy that MSI did not decorate this laptop with the cliche gaming laptop bright colors and extravagant designs on the outside of the laptop. It is a simply bushed metal look; the only sign that the laptop is a gaming laptop is the MSI Dragon logo on the top",""
"3632"," MSI was able to squeeze everything you would need. The battery cable also has a 90 degree bend so it does not get in the way. ","","","","","Ports: For being such a thin laptop",""
"3633"," but I use a Bluetooth mouse anyhow (and the connectivity is great.)","","","","","Trackpad: Others have complained about the trackpad. I think it is pretty good. The one issue is that you have to put some pressure to get a click to register",""
"3634"," and the Stealth checks every box. This laptop can get a consistent 6+ hours of battery life when doing light work (such as writing this review)"," watching videos"," etc. When I'm not gaming"," I set the laptop to Windows Battery Saver"," which is one click in the toolbar.

"3639"," this laptop checks every box that I had for a classwork computer and a gaming computer for a comparatively low price. Anyone who is searching for a laptop with the same expectations as I have without having to spend $2000+ on the only competitor in the Razer Blade should get this laptop.

"3705"," looks great and even with long gaming sessions the fan doesn’t get to loud and even better it keeps the temps under control. The new six core Intel processor is a beast. It really is a big step up from the previous generation and its about time Intel put out a product like this. Prior i7 processors were a little bit better each time but not by much. The eighth generation processors really are a nice performance boost. Add a true 6GB Nvidia GTX 1060 and 1080p gaming is like butter. I have connected it to my 34” widescreen 2k G-Sync monitor and it pushes it just fine. I do have to turn down some of the game setting from my desktop computer but that would be true for any GTX 1060. Oh and G-Sync was working just fine on the display port connector. You might need to get an adapter since the laptop only has a mini displayport connector. But that's a small trade off for how thin this laptop is. It has a great RGB Steelseries keyboard. It is fun to have the lights going and there are many setting options including turning them off if you want. I like how if you hit the FN key only the keys that are tied to that function key light up. It makes finding the keys to change the screen brightness or volume easy to find. One problem I always have with laptops is the trackpad. I do like the one here. It maynot be the best but it feels and works just fine. I would still game with a mouse but it never got in the way. There is much to like here but there is room for improvement. One thing I do not understand is why MSI elected to use a SSD drive in the M.2 connector. The difference in the speed of the M.2 drives over SSD drives is three to four times faster. And in this laptop it is quite difficult to change. Now that I have many hours on it I don’t find it to be a problem but it just seems silly to have the faster connection and not use it. Once the warranty is over I might think about changing it but it is a minor annoyance. The screen is bright and colorful. There are better screens to be found but the price goes up. Still I like the screen and really don’t have any complaints. I would have liked it to be a G-Sync screen with a higher refresh rate but it is a nice screen and the GTX 1060 is a good match for it. I have not had many MSI products but this feels very solid and there is almost no flex. Also they have put a felt pad on the bottom. This was a good decision because you can surf with in on your lap and it doesn’t get hot. That’s partly due to the felt padding and also this laptop uses the Intel integrated graphics on the CPU when you not playing a game in full screen. Very cool and that means I am getting in excess of 4 or 5 hours of battery when I am doing other things besides gaming. To game you will always want to be connected to an outlet so it can run at full speed as much as possible. I am very satisfied with almost everything about this laptop. Now if I could just get my employer to see the light and buy this for work and trash out the business laptops we are issued. With this processor and graphics on hand it can make those travel days just a bit better and the actual work I do faster. Very well done MSI.

We actually did little research about PC builds before making this MSI GS63 Stealth-010 purchase in-store at Best Buy. I would give many plus points for this laptop due to its user interface setup. With the Steelseries Engine 3"," you can easily assess to your keyboard and handle its backlights as much as you wish. I was super impressed with the entire build in SteelSeries Engine app (Configurations Windows). You can create your own space in this device by customizing various functions in the Configurations Windows manually. My keyboard was overly satisfactory and responsive; easy to type on it for long hours. This laptop has a different range of battery modes. You can change the battery modes through the Dragon Center app. I set mine to ECO mode when not running games (when running on ECO mode"," battery life stays longer). The display is not a touchscreen (better battery saver) and it is 15.6 Full Widescreen LED (1920 x 1080 resolution). The cooler boost works properly when switching between apps or running a game like Overwatch. I do expect a gaming laptop with less fan noise"," it doesn't bother me much when operating heavy systems and apps. The storage is upgradeable 256GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive which is plenty of space for your PC apps and games. NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 is one of the best features for most gaming PCs. The NVIDIA Geforce experience did an excellent job over my expectations. I have no issue when playing my video games for multiple hours.","","The last time I bought a laptop that could game it was a big disappointment. This 15.6-inch MSI GS63 Stealth Thin-010 gaming laptop has completely changed the way I look at gaming laptops. This competes with the best the industry has to offer in its price range.

I still mostly use a wireless mouse instead.

I have a iPad and 17 laptop and was looking for something small with full Windows OS. However after using the Surface Pro for a few weeks I have come to the conclusion that I don't use the Surface Pro as a tablet; without the keyboard. The kickstand limits the flexibility of the device. For example you cannot use the keyboard without the kickstand pulled out. As the keyboard hinge cannot support the weight of the screen"," unlike a traditional laptop. Therefore a traditional laptop requires less table depth"," than the Surface Pro. Due to the distance from the hinge to the kickstand.

"3833"," until my retirement. I found the various Dell laptops I used to be solid"," if not very inspiring machines (and therefore found the name Inspiron a little ironic). So when I had an opportunity to acquire a Dell 2-in-1 4K Ultra HD Inspiron 15 in exchange for writing a review of it"," I jumped at the chance. The specs on this laptop are very good: An Intel i7 CPU"," a 256GB SSD"," and the 4K screen powered by a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce MX130 GPU.

Ironically"," HP used to recommend an older Dell active pen for use with their Spectre x360 laptops"," when researching this pen to see if I could get it to work with my HP"," I found many Dell users who thought that this pen would work with their model and were disappointed when it did not. I also discovered that Dell apparently uses a different protocol (MPP instead of AES) with a slightly different 2-in-1 model (the 7579). You have to be really careful if you want to use an active pen to make sure that it works with your laptop. I don't know why the industry can't settle on standards to prevent confusion.","It was nice that an active pen (model number PN338M) was included with the laptop.

The 15.6 is display is better than my old hp 17.3 and is still light enough that it is easy to carry. This pc really has a thin form factor but still big gaming capability.

I knew the fans were going to be loud"," but the level of noise greatly exceeded my expectations. To give you an idea of how loud it is"," it is almost like being in a plane that is taking off. I don't know if it was just the one I bought but it would get very loud and very often. I was not even using resource heavy applications with it. The most demanding thing I did with the computer when I had it for a night was play League of Legends. If you buy this computer"," school"," a coffee shop"," the battery life is good.

I didn't want to spend more than $2k on a new rig but I wanted at least a GTX 1070 with 16GB of RAM and 8th gen Intel chip. The Stealth Thin checked all the boxes and came in right at my budget. I immediately moved around the partitions and dual booted it with Ubuntu and have installed my deep learning workflow without too much trouble (watch out for secure boot with the Nvidia drivers). Right after testing my work setup I downloaded Steam and found that some of my favorite games (e.g. Stellaris) actually load faster in Ubuntu on this 'top than they did in Win 10. All around I am really pleased with my purchase. One of the only downsides I've seen is that the lid/screen flexes a bit as you open and close it. It seems a fair trade to have it be so thin and light but I'm always wary of it.

I did a ton of research and had a hard time choosing between the GS65 and the Asus Zephyrus M. My main hesitations are that the GS65 could have problems with thermals and I don't historically like MSI's trackpads"," it is my favorite laptop on the market"," the clean black with gold trip and vents is perfect for work. The I/Os on this thing is everything I will need in the future. The keyboard feels like a macbook and I love it for typing and gaming. I know a lot of people complain about the mouse"," they lack power in the low range. Granted"," also the Zephyrus M has the full 1070 and the venting to cool it. Ultimately I wanted a real battery and when I got my hands on the MS65 and I absolutely love this thing. Aesthetically"

I really enjoy using the pen - but don't always get 100% accuracy when drawing or writing. It is not always a fluid line when you would want it to be. The only other reasons I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it seems to heat up right in the middle where you would hold it in your lap when it is converted into a tablet. This is not comfortable to watch a movie or use it for a long period of time. Additionally the fan is a little loud when it is cooling off. otherwise - this is a fun and stylish computer.

This Model Could be Improved.,MarkusKong,0,3,Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0001US)","The Legion Y530 is a good value entry-level gaming laptop with a great design"," and very decent hardware (6-core Intel Core i7"
"4430","","","","","","Setup/Testing/Conclusion",""
"4431"," 8GB DDR4 2666 memory"," and an Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. Let’s go ahead and dive right in and see how this budget Gaming Laptop performs.","","","","The Lenovo Legion Y530 (81FV0001US). Packed with an Intel i7 8750H",""
"4432"," the Intel i7 8750H is an excellent CPU. You’re looking at the successor to the widely popular Intel i7 7700HQ which is what was used a lot in previous gaming laptops. With the Intel i7 8750H"," you’re going to be getting about a 10% increase in single core performance and about a 15 ~ 25% increase in multi-core performance. The Nvidia 4GB GeForce GTX 1050 Ti isn’t the fastest or considered a “high end” GPU"," but it’s definitely considered as one of the best (if not the best) budget GPU. This specific version of the Lenovo Legion Y530 only comes with 8GB of memory and a traditional mechanical hard drive. So before I even ran any games"," not a top of the line gaming beast. So now that we got that out the way"," let’s go ahead and see what this combo brings to the table.","Right off the bat"," my expectations weren’t going to be through the roof. I mean we’re looking at a budget gaming rig here"
"4433"," this specific Lenovo Legion Y530 performs decent. As mentioned previously"," it’s not going to be the fastest out there; but it’s definitely not the slowest. So if you’re looking to play everything on ultra presets and expect incredible frames per second"," I would probably invest in a pretty high end gaming rig. If you’re looking to play games on a combination of low ~ medium presets"," Battlefield 1 (60 FPS)"," Tom Clancy’s The Division (60 FPS)","As expected"," you’ll be just fine with this Lenovo Legion Y530 model. I was able to run games like Counter-Strike Global Offensive (140 FPS)"
"4434"," and Diablo 3 (95 FPS) without any FPS drops. I did for a weird reason encounter micro stutters/skips while gaming though.","","","",""," GTA V (55 FPS)",""
"4435"," I didn’t have a problem taking it around. Because of it’s subtle and sleek design"," it doesn’t scream “GAMING”; yet it doesn’t look like an ordinary laptop. I personally enjoy the black design and look of the laptop. Although the Y530 is made majority of plastic"," it's still quite durable and still looks good. Lenovo changed the backlit keyboard from red to white which looks a lot better. The bezels around the screen (left"," and right) are also quite thin compared to the last years model. Because of the thin bezel change"," the webcam was moved to below the screen. So if you plan on using the webcam","With the Legion Y530"," top"
"4436"," I’ll definitely make that trade any day; smaller bezels vs having the camera at the top. If you currently own the last year’s model"," you’ll also notice that a lot of the ports have been placed in the back of the laptop. You’ll still have access to a USB 3.1 port on either side of the laptop. The reason for this is so that it offers better cooling. Overall"," the thermals on the Y530 is pretty decent. When gaming"," I wasn’t as impressed. I wished it was a bit brighter and the color reproduction was better. So if you were to use the Y530 in a more lit environment"," you may have some difficulty viewing the screen. The 52.5Wh 3-cell lithium ion battery lasted about 4 hours with my usage which is typically expected with these type of setups. If you’re gaming on it constantly"," be prepared to show off your nose and in addition to the other party seeing your knuckles a lot if you're typing. But"," the CPU did get pretty hot (95c ~ 97c) while the GPU didn’t really heat up that much. The fans do get quite loud under load so make sure you have some headphones on. When it comes to the picture/screen quality"
"4437","","","","",""," the battery probably won’t last as long as 4 hours. So be prepared to bring your charger with you! ",""

"4446","","","","","","Wished battery lasted longer",""
"4447"," this Lenovo Legion Y530 has pretty decent all around performance. I didn’t experience any frame rate drops during gaming but did experience micro stutters. My settings on average were around low ~ medium (Nvidia Presets/Recommended). I would’ve liked to see Lenovo release all Legion Y530 with a GTX 1060 and a SSD by default (as this specific model comes with a traditional mechanical hard drive). I know they have other models but from what I could find; GTX 1050 Ti is all they have currently. Overall"," I would give this specific model 3 out of 5 stars. Lenovo did do an excellent job by ditching the red and making the Legion Y530 very sleek (excellent redesign Lenovo!). Where it falls short on this specific model is with the traditional mechanical hard drive and the GTX 1050 Ti. Because of no SSD"," the boot times and load times are pretty excruciating. I would say that if you’re on a really tight budget"," I would definitely recommend that.","","In conclusion"," this specific model may be for you. But if you’re able to dish out some more money for the version with an SSD"

Most of my work is on a Windows laptop"," but I use a MacBook Pro for photo editing etc at home. I wanted to be able to use touchscreen functions on my editing so I am trying this XPS 2-1 out to see how it stacks up. I do most of my editing in Adobe CC Lightroom and Photoshop CC so the interfaces are not much different when going from MAC to Windows. The performance of the XPS laptop while editing is very fast. Imports of RAW files from a Sony a7riii are very fast and that is using a 1-1 preview which generally slows down the process. Now there are other factors involved as well such as SD Card speed etc. From what I have used in the exact same setup with my MacBook Pro 2017 with the Quad Core i7 2.8 the XPS matches or exceeds the import speeds. Edits in Lightroom also are very fast and very little lag is present. Exporting of files is also very fast and is slightly faster than the MacBook Pro. The real difference maker is the touch and pen functions. Being able to zoom in and out with fingers is much better","","","Buy this if you want something to do light gaming on"," brush adjustments with the pen are great as well. "
"4506"," I have had a few cases of the laptop being buggy with slowdowns or freezing"," but this is to be expected with Windows when comparing to Mac OS. Windows has come a long way and X is a very good operating system that really adds a lot of integration tools like Apple does with Mac OS.

The sound is natural and warm - not tinny or boxy like a lot of laptops I've used.","","","","Had it a couple of weeks now and love it. Great form factor - light",""

I took it in 4 times before I finally requested to get a brand new surface laptop. I was told this would fix the problem because it was just a defective computer. Not even 2 weeks with the new computer and the SAME thing happened.

"4620"," I just learned from Lenovo support that once you charge up the battery you need to unplug the charger from both the wall and the computer. Seems Windows has some type of safety feature that blocks the charger from continuing to charge after 90%.

NOTE: the charger gets noticeably warm if you leave it plugged into the wall"," so you need to unplug it from there if your laptop is charged.","","","","Also",""
"4621","","","","","","I have noticed that the machine is getting slower and slower to boot up and perform tasks. I attribute that to Windows since initially the computer was reasonably fast. It has the latest 8th generation i3 CPU and DDR4 RAM.",""

"4626","","","","","","The 8 GB of memory seems to be an ideal amount. I usually don't use more than about 60% of that.",""
"4627"," but the Intel 620 graphics is not bad (passmark 995"," an NVDIA GTX 1050 is 4566). I tried running the Unigine Heaven benchmark and it gave about 16 fps on high with normal tessellation as compared with 66 fps for an i7 6700HQ/GTX 960M combination.","","","","It is not a gaming machine",""

The 2nd time I brought it in I decided to buy a back up computer. The Lenovo 15 inch computer is a great little computer. I love the keyboard on this computer. The letters are much larger and easy to see. The keys seem flatter and a little bit larger than my 17 which making it easier to type letters on it. It is the right size to pick up and go in comparison to my 17 inch laptop. The Lenovo has enough software to accomplish what you need to get done. The Graphics are great. It's like the pictures have more depth to them with Brilliant Colors. It has enough power and speed for emails","I originally went looking for a machine with a 1920x1024 ips screen"," a 1 TB HDD and 6-8 hours on battery. The reviews of the laptops in my budget (~$500) typically had 1920x1024 TN displays that were not well reviewed and either a 256 GB SSD or a 1 TB HDD. Often they did not have a DVD drive.

The laptop is wonderful. Battery life is amazing getting 8 to 9 hours of use before it needs charging. Keep in mind this is not at max brightness. Keyboard is easy to type on. Screen has a little bit of wobble to it but nothing to be concerned with. Laptop cold boots in 5 or 6 seconds.. and wakes from sleep in 2-3 seconds. The Top panel behind the LCD display is very solid unlike some other laptops I have owned where I felt like I could break the screen easily. The LCD is bright and easily seen on its max brightness level. The biggest thing for me is noise.. I have yet to even hear the fan come on. I use this for audio tuning with a MIC which means I need the laptop silent. I didn't notice any heat on the palm rest area after use. The underside does get a bit warm but I never found it to be a problem for me. For the money the specs are great! I am a 20 year IT Tech and could not be happier with this laptop purchase.

It is not the fasted computer and this not a high end computer so don't expect it to be high end and accept it for what it is and you'll be satisfied. I bought laptop as temporary Stop Gap computer when my Asus gaming computer crashed. Only paid $217 out the door and that is a hard price to beat. Installed my own licensed copy of Office 2016 pro. It took hours to install all Windows 10 updates to get the software current. That's expected so no big deal. Just be prepared to spend setup time before you really start using the machine full time. I'll install more RAM soon - it can go to 16GB memory so that is a plus. The computer is quiet"

Just type Windows Defender in the search box and click on Windows Defender Security Center. Go to Device Performance and Health and click Additional Info under Fresh Start. It will uninstall all the unwanted apps and programs and give you a fresh copy of Windows 10. IT takes about an hour though but its worth it and makes a huge difference. And then also I uninstalled all the programs I didn't need. I also set the number of processors to 2.

"4684"," but tonight even the restore failed. So I am sitting here with what amounts to a $250 paperweight. After a whole three hours of use. What a piece of junk.

I only need a computer to get online while traveling and this did not even meet those meager needs. I took it back to the Rapid City store and exchanged it for a HP. It cost $170 more but it runs 1","000 times better. Spend a little bit more money and get a better computer. I have two Dell towers for my home computer and have not had problems.

Before purchasing I explained to the store rep what I was looking for he assured me they would be very good computers for what I needed. If you are wanting to do anything on the internet do not purchase this laptop! How ever if you just want to use it for spread sheets and stuff like that then yes it will work. It is a little slower than i expected when opening up excel or anything for that matter. I would recommend you save your money and get a slightly better computer. Lesson learned here.

It’s just been ridiculously slow out of the box and now barely works with out restarting it several times. It’s not worth the money or aggravation. By the time that I get the browser opened I could of done 5 separate tasks on my Mac. There is ZERO reason why this computer is so slow.

In addition to game play I also use it for video editing and it does a nice job although it uses hard disk access to augment RAM when needed. I would prefer more RAM.
